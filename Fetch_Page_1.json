            "transcript": "Ty Phillippay:\nKyle. \nKyle Sexton:\nHey, what's up, Ty? \nTy Phillippay:\nHow are you? \nKyle Sexton:\nGreat. How are you doing? \nTy Phillippay:\nYou know, a few more gray hairs here and there, but. \nKyle Sexton:\nGot through it is your is your season, like window did it just finish up? \nTy Phillippay:\nIt's almost there, we're getting there. Um, now we've just got kind of the the the task of like. It reminds me of post-war. Somebody had to go out and figure out, so are you, like, dead? or are you gonna get up, you know, like civil war? It feels a little like because we have a lot of people who are somewhere in the process of signing up. Who? Just, you know, they get off to something else. So we're trying to just, yeah, get after all of them and say, Hey, it's not too late. How can we help? Yet? That kind of stuff. But we're having a great result metrically, which is obviously very important this stage of the game. Awesome, how about you? \nKyle Sexton:\nUh, good, good, you know, I just came across a um, I was just going through some old meeting notes and I, I, I record. Some meetings that are when I do what I'm doing with chambers and I help them build a new menu. And then we go present the new structure to members for the first time. I record some of those meetings and we met with a few years back. We met with a. Hey, Gary. We met with a health insurance cooperative. That might mean something to you. \nTy Phillippay:\nYep. \nKyle Sexton:\nI was in the meeting for an hour and I still am not exactly sure how they, you know, they, they say they compete with Blue Cross and all that. So, um, and they mentioned in that meeting, according to the transcript, um, Icra, and how that was an emerging thing at the time. I think this was on 22 or 23. It's probably 22. \nTy Phillippay:\nThat's impressive. That'd be, that'd be somebody who was paying attention to the news, and it was some semi-early stages from heck, I don't remember well, Gary, when did you first hear about it? were you on it early? did you see what? What it could be? \nGary Daniels:\nYeah, like 2021, something like that, yeah, a certain boiling on quite a bit. \nKyle Sexton:\nGary. \nTy Phillippay:\nIn his ivory tower. He used to have a man who would come in and read all of his emails to him during his morning soak. All right, let's let's kick this off, gentlemen. I'm just gonna jump into, uh, a go roll here. \nKyle Sexton:\nSo we've got your morning. Wait, Gary, your morning spoke. This has got to be legendary. \nTy Phillippay:\nYeah. It was a bad job for the other guy, but it was probably great. \nKyle Sexton:\nI love it. \nTy Phillippay:\nCall this meeting to order. We, the Knights templar of the Chamber Brotherhood of the Fellowship, have a job to do. And we've known that we were going to embark on this for a while. And I think we've all had starts and stops around ideas of how we would. Be in a role. But I think, frankly, the best use of my time, and probably your time, Kyle, is for us to let Gary kick off and just start. Telling the things that are available chamber related. And then I think our goal after the fact, Kyle certainly is. Let's button up partnership and make sure we're all comfortable and have total clarity on what that would look like. And then, you know, it's just time to start executing. So, Gary, have you prepared remarks or how do you want to start this off? \nGary Daniels:\nNo, um, first of all, it's good to see you, Kyle. It's been so. Just I'll just back up. Because I think just sharing where we are in our business right now is important. And the ebbs and flows that we've gone through. We've had an incredibly successful January 1 cycle. To a degree that, as you read Slack and everything else that's in, it's not shocking, but shocking just for the amount of membership that we've written. Response to some of the stuff that we build on behalf of consumers, the interaction. We built a direct-to-employer function. It's more like a test case. And the reason why we did that is because we were curious if an employer would truly go out and self-serve by themselves, meaning no sales interaction, no phone number, no brokers, just generic marketing. And essentially, what we did is we marketed in five states, California, and it's like five states, about 27 geographies, California, Texas, Florida, Illinois, New York. And what we found through that process is, yes, we've had 340 employers attach their business bank account to us just since August. We've had over 1300 quotes since August. And we are alive with 226 employers that range from two employees up to 48, I think is our biggest one. Um, and so we use that process to. I sit with some of our folks and I watch. Like, how people use the mouse and how we, you know, structure different buttons on the page and all that technical stuff. But what it's teaching us is the more intuitive that we can build this product set. The more that employers are using it, and the more they're willing to actually self-serve. And the reason why that, and we're going to run it through January, I'm building like an entire white paper around it because it's such a unique experience. And the reason why that is so important is because the same way that we built, like the Sarasota Chamber, FACP, there's like a handful of them where we have built our kind of co-branded website. It's the same exact quoting tool set. That is live and employers are using on a direct basis today. So it's kind of that same intuitive structure that has a very simplistic, co-branded site that these chambers can attach to their chamber website and call it healthcare, whatever they want to do. So I say all that because it's been an incredible learning for us. We're super pumped. We just announced last week I was in New Jersey. We are now a part of what's referred to as ADP Run, which is their fully integrated offering. They don't let anyone attach to ADP Run. It's like their holy grail of control. And we were mentioned on the earnings call by their CEO, which also doesn't normally happen for a small company. And so we are super proud of this, I would say very tough, but very micro. Focus on small business and how intuitive that we could make. Our tool sets for the hardest business to operate in, which is small business. If you could win in small business, we can scale in anything. If you scale additional account level, it's really hard to scale into small business. And so we are still feeling really good about what this means for chambers, our chamber relationships. I think the technology is in the right place. The communication structure is in the right place. Now it's just a matter of how we market to them. So that's my. \nKyle Sexton:\nThat's a pretty big update, Gary. I mean, the fact that self-service is on and, I mean, ADP is, you know, obviously a really huge brand and small business. They run a lot of payroll and other services for a lot of small businesses and communities that these chambers are also operating. So that's big. It's big. \nGary Daniels:\nYeah. You know, it's interesting because I tell everybody in what we sell in ICHRA, the rate is the rate is the rate. Meaning it doesn't matter if you, Kyle, live where you live in Salem, and you work for a 10,000-person employer, or if you... Self-employ yourself, your rates still the same. And, you know, for us again, to be able to do things in a small business environment. Build a financial model that will allow us to sell one and two man lives and still make money. And then to scale that up into these really large employer sets, which is the goal for this next cycle. I think it bodes really well for our commitment to the the end consumer, the small business employer. And figuring out how we continue to take that upstream. I think also bodes well for chamber relationships because the last thing they want to do is refer somebody. That the technology fails a consumer, the billing fails a consumer. Like, that's not the type of relationships that they want to be able to bolt on to their their brand. And I think ADP is a good reflection that we're doing things the right way. \nKyle Sexton:\nSo yeah. And your relationship with the Sarasota Chamber, they're a past client of mine. \nGary Daniels:\nAre you? \nKyle Sexton:\nIs that a is that one of those that you built a self-serve model around? And I'm assuming you got that relationship from your sponsorship of FACP. \nGary Daniels:\nYeah. So Ed Hill, I think it was Ed Hill. Does that sound, right? \nKyle Sexton:\nThey've been through a few execs. Yeah. Let's see if I can find it. \nGary Daniels:\nI thought it was Ed. \nTy Phillippay:\nI think it's Ed. \nGary Daniels:\nYeah. Ed Hill. So. He is now running the chamber. He is like Boober Gun Ho. In fact, we did the FACP event. I didn't do it. Taryn went out for me. I think we had 10 chambers that reached out to us wanting to figure out what a path forward looks like. Sarasota by far is the most aggressive. So we built a front end, co-branded site for them. I think we meet with Ed tomorrow. \nKyle Sexton:\nTomorrow, Ed's a VP. Yeah. \nGary Daniels:\nYeah. Is it tomorrow we meet with Ed? Yeah. Tomorrow, we meet with Ed and walk him through the process. \nKyle Sexton:\nSo that's awesome. And so is that that's not for this past window. That's for this upcoming 26 campaign. Help me understand where you get like. I know you guys just finished a huge sprint. And so are you still under what's considered open enrollment or enrollment? \nGary Daniels:\nI, you know, that's. It's a unique thing for the individual business in a sense that open enrollment really starts November 1st and kind of goes to January 15th. Um, for us selling Icra, we sell throughout the entire year, so we're already selling cases for two, one, three, one, four, one, five, one. Yeah, um, and so yeah. Open enrollment specifically for individual after. These carriers have made their plan design changes that start effective January 1st. That's kind of when everything coincides, but for us, it's full go year round. \nKyle Sexton:\nWow, what an opportunity. Uh, does that not give you like a huge competitive edge? Yeah, it does, yeah, and and how? wow. How is it that the laws have not yet caught up with this one? Because, like, um, like the big insurance companies that have that are that are stuck under, you know, the open enrollment policies. Like, wouldn't, aren't they, aren't they screaming about this? \nGary Daniels:\nNo, no. If you think about what the group environment does, they still sell groups by January, February, March, April, May, all those effective dates. \nKyle Sexton:\nYeah, um, you know, so this? You could make the argument that this is efficient for them. \nGary Daniels:\nYeah, uh, yeah, actually yes, because that's all the buying. Well, and um, the other thing it does for them is it puts people in standard plan designs. So you think about the group environment. If you're an employer with more than 51 lives, you can customize your plan, and that becomes an administrative headache for carriers. It creates lots of downstream ramifications around claims and everything else. And the individual plans have to be filed with CMS. They're regulated by CMS, regulated by state regulators. There's a lot less of them. You can't customize them. They're straight off the shelf, which makes it very effective for the carriers. \nTy Phillippay:\nOkay, and for providers to understand as well. \nKyle Sexton:\nYep, yep, wow, okay, so yeah. So what do you think, Ty? What's the what's the best route to onboard any particular chamber? Or in quantity in your? \nTy Phillippay:\nYeah, a couple litmus tests that I've been through? We know Gary can sell this stuff, right? Um, we sent Taryn, who is a great team member, energy, bubbly. She probably could have signed up a hundred chambers. I mean, if she was in the right room, it's. This is an easy thing to get started. I think it's a challenging thing to scale and set proper expectations and hold hands through the. You know, there's going to be a dynamic where a junior person or a biz dev person at the chambers. I got this great idea and we've sold them then the real sale with the person who's kind of the final approver. So it's just getting more of our kung fu down of how do we generally handle the. Each step of the process. I would love to be formulaic in the materials that we use. And I know, Kyle, you made a great offer to help us with that. But I'm speaking now more so of just kind of bedrock things that we need to arm chambers with. And I've got a list of a lot of those already, but we probably need a little marketing juge on them. And then, Gary, my biggest concern is going out, getting 100 chambers interested, and then having to tell... 50 of them that it's going to be six months before we can build the microsite that's for them. So when we talk about these sites, are you thinking that we would first go to the states and try and land our site on the state site? And then avoid having a bunch of microsites for the larger chambers? Or what are your thoughts on kind of sequence here? \nGary Daniels:\nYeah, so great question or question. And so. Really, basically, what we've been doing is essentially walking these chambers through for those that already understand what Ichra is. So, for example, in the slide deck, like, we've done a lot of education around, like, what Ichra is, how does it work? Like, what do we do with patch? We've had a bazillion of those conversations. And I would say that we are OK at them in a sense that. The neighbors are still used to this group health insurance model and how it's so different. So what I would tell you is we're actually doing this. At the marketing level, too, is how do we communicate what ICHR is and what that does. A more simplistic level, specifically for the employer? And what are the ramifications of that decision on behalf of employees? So you'll see us get a lot better over the next few months around, just. Pure communication, branding, etc. What we've shared at the 10 000 foot level. And I don't know if I think I've sent this over to you before, Kyle. But we've built in a very simplistic pricing model where we give chambers a 20 discount based off your pricing that's on the web page. So if you went through that direct portal, um, and you got pricing versus if you go through a chamber relationship, you will see a 20% difference in pricing. We want to advantage the chambers. We want them to feel like there is value. They're not just making money off of this relationship, but they're actually providing value to their employers and our community. That's differentiated. What we basically put out there was a flat $5 per employee per month that's paid out annually. So the nice thing about the website and the reason why we did the website, the way we did it. Is because, say, you know, Ty owns a business that sits within the Sarasota Chamber footprint. They come into the chamber and say, hey, do you guys do anything special around health insurance? And, you know, Ed Hill goes, hey, Ty, we got this great relationship with that. They do ICRA, controls your costs. Your employees can pick their own plan design. You get a tax break for it. And oh, by the way, you can go out and quote it yourself, or you can have your broker quote it. But a lot of people go out and quote it themselves. If they start that process directly off their website, we know because it came in through their browser. And we automatically assign that group to the Sarasota Chamber in terms of like, the compensation, the process, etc. Same thing for the relationships that you bring in. And be the way that we have ability to attach you to the chamber, to the membership that we write, etc. So, um, so we make it as simplistic as we possibly can. When that quote comes in, it goes into our teams. It's highlighted as a chamber opportunity. It creates a different level of awareness. It goes into a different team in terms of pricing. So again, we've tried to make it as seamless as we possibly can for us to turn those quotes around. \nKyle Sexton:\nOkay. \nGary Daniels:\nAnd then, yeah, we've just been showing them. Like, just general features of the site, which is pretty straightforward. And it's just a matter of how quickly they want to get these up and running or not. \nKyle Sexton:\nWhat are some of the resources that chambers like Sarasota are asking for in terms of collateral and content? \nGary Daniels:\nYeah, so that's where the microsite comes in, yeah, the microsite. Uh, we put out some, um, what I'd say are new explainer videos, so that are pretty good. Um, and so we're starting to attach those to the front of the site, which is just a really easy like. I think both of them are 60 second, uh. Explainer videos on what Hickory is, how that operates and how you allow employees to have choice. Mechanically, I think we could do a lot more work on our content pieces. The challenge with the content pieces, as soon as they publish them, which, you know, they're outdated. And trying to keep all this stuff updated on a regular basis becomes a challenge. \nTy Phillippay:\nAnd I mean, in my experience now, I'm heavily reliant on links to a page that that supports. It's not the most elegant look, but it's very functional. And we can bypass most of the spam issues that we've had with mailers in the past by just putting a raw link in there. And oddly, I've gotten bigger uptake. When I put a raw link in versus, I was doing an extra step of making it look like a button. So it's funny. I think that one of the kind of guiding principles, I think we need to define who are the employers that we will write through this. And that's something that I'd like to work with you on, Kyle, is like, ICP. So that when we do engage with them, let's say they have 500 business opportunities. Why wouldn't we do everything possible to get the 50 best first and then the best 500? And I've got the ability to orchestrate that with metrics on the group. And it definitely has to do with what states are we hot in? And then average age. So you'll learn some things pretty quickly about how I want to help. People to get not only signed up, but really land that first win, like, do everything we can to like get one fish in the boat with them. And I see that as a way that like you and I, or a video and some follow-up. However, we are going to do it where you and I are. A little bit like the British bulldogs here. Where you're going to know more stuff about chambers, I'm going to know more stuff about insurance. We're just going to keep blending that into the tool and the communication that that we need. And then we just want to make sure the last thing here. I just feel like there's going to be a lot of people really wanting metrics because it's a new thing. Their sales for biz dev person is saying, Well, did they get Bob's trucking last month? Is there a way that we can keep a resource for the chamber point of contact month over month to see it? Is that something we've built, for sure? Yeah, we already have that? \nGary Daniels:\nYep. \nTy Phillippay:\nOkay, cool. I wasn't sure. \nGary Daniels:\nYeah, what we're doing is behind the scenes because we're using that quote kind of quote tool as a front door for a bunch of different relationships. So it's also the relationship for ADP. Paychex has a co-branded site. Chambers, obviously, and behind that again, the way that we're able to, when we build the site, then attach the browser, that sets off the quoting, the reporting. Our ability to capture all that data is pretty tight-knit at the end of the day. We can even see the type of contribution models. If they're doing dynamic or if they're doing flat, we can see pretty much everything and provide that as reporting. \nTy Phillippay:\nAwesome. \nGary Daniels:\nYeah, I think the big thing is it's more of, I think the best way for you to think about positioning this, Kyle, again, I think for you, I mean, this is me talking out loud, not knowing how the business operates from your lens. But, you know, one, clearly offering small business health insurance is important. In fact, on the Neo stuff, over 70% of the groups that we're writing didn't have health insurance previously. \nTy Phillippay:\nWild. That is a wild stat. \nGary Daniels:\nThat's awesome. Yeah, which is what we do, right? Like, it's hard to do that. It's hard to build a tool that serves one and two person shops. But if you're a chamber, that's the bulk of the business that's coming in to figure out how to get group health insurance. And historically, groups haven't been able to do that because of eligibility rules. They have a minimum group size. They have, like all these rules, specifically around small business. In an Ichra that... Doesn't apply. It's more about the contribution that the employer sets and making sure that they meet minimum affordability. So a slightly different standard, but it becomes a really good story for the chambers. They make money, they're giving, they have a tool that gives health insurance to people who don't have access to it. And for the larger employers, that have access to health insurance but haven't been able to control their own cost profile. Because their renewals are high every year, this allows them to actually take control of their cost and give employees choice in the meantime. So that's at the 10 000 foot level, that's how we've been doing it. Um, I think it's kind of a no-brainer for chambers to want to introduce something like that, but that's just me talking out loud. And if there's a better way to pitch it, it's all up to you. And we'd be happy to support it in some way, shape or form. \nTy Phillippay:\nAnd then part of it might be because I've been holding people's hand. But my thinking is, even once somebody has said, I think we're going to go with this crazy ECRA thing and we're moving towards it. There's always a question or two. Well, what do we do for the kid that is a dependent going to college out of our state? You know, all these things that come up. So, Gary, in that scenario, as long as they're actively quoting and they've gotten through, you know, into our system. Would that be a thatch support question? \nGary Daniels:\nYep. \nTy Phillippay:\nThat was the right answer. That's exactly what I wanted. Because these ones have been, I think. We've set people up to start to ask too many questions by being just too attentive to questions, to be honest. So, awesome. \nKyle Sexton:\nWhat do you anticipate, the biggest bottleneck to getting a chamber on board? Just functionally, we got a yes from them. \nGary Daniels:\nWhat's the bottleneck after that? Nothing. It's just a really matter of how much they want to promote it. One of the discussions we had in preliminary with Ed was he actually wants us to be able to come out and do in-person meetings. He wants to be able to talk about ICHRA. He wants to be able to promote it. I was like, yeah, we're all up for that. We just have to be able to schedule it. If that becomes something we do for everyone, being able to scale, that becomes a pretty serious bottleneck. And so, I think for us, it's making sure that, yes, we can do those things. And I have no problem committing to coming out for those types of events, we just have to make sure that, um, we think we can actually get people to attend. We only have, you know, 20 something sales people that are literally working, you know, 14 15 hour days today. Let alone as we go the chamber environment and open this up. \nKyle Sexton:\nMORE Okay, yeah, well, um, you know. An efficient and efficiency that I think you can look forward to. Is as these larger chambers, like Sarasota, who have influence in their in their general vicinity and also throughout the state. Um, there's going to be less and less reluctance on the part of medium and smaller chambers. Um, around, around pulling the trigger. And so, you know, besides Sarasota, and I think you guys were talking about Big Sky Montana at some point. Is that right? \nGary Daniels:\nYeah, Big Sky. \nKyle Sexton:\nHe did a lot of research for a long time. \nGary Daniels:\nTheir challenge is they also work with United Healthcare. And he has a level-funded product with Big Sky that I built for him. I'm totally blanking on his name right now. I also want to say it's Ed, but it's not Ed. Ed's stuck in my head. Yeah, Brad, Brad, that's right, Brad came from Oregon. Eventually, he used to be the CEO for, Yeah, he was a tour operator. Yeah, yeah, um, so yeah, we've. We've absolutely talked a lot about being able to offer an anchor opportunity for them and we would be happy to. It's just a matter of, I think, worried about what that would mean for their level funded business. \nKyle Sexton:\nSure, yeah. Do you have any other examples other than Sarasota of chambers who are onboarded? \nGary Daniels:\nUm, we built the site for FACP, Tammy had talked about it. She was a little worried about, but she doesn't want to be pulling revenue away from her chamber partners, which I fully appreciate, But she was super pumped about it. We've had discussions with Minnesota. We've had discussions with Indiana, the larger statewide chambers. \nKyle Sexton:\nYeah. \nGary Daniels:\nWho else did we talk with? \nTy Phillippay:\nIllinois, Oregon, Washington. \nGary Daniels:\nLisa, we've had discussions with on Illinois. We're probably going to try to circle back around with them at some point. But to be honest, yeah, we've just gotten so damn busy. And as I've said multiple times, like, I want to make sure that when we're talking with chambers, that we are incredibly attentive to them. And we have kind of the right foundation built. And I think we now have the right foundation built. And that's going to start with the Sarasota chamber. The way that we build the sites is just more of somebody that wants to go out and hustle and communicate with these chambers. That speaks their language. That as they're looking for revenue opportunity, this is a good revenue opportunity that is really good for their local businesses. \nKyle Sexton:\nSo, yeah. \nTy Phillippay:\nDo you think the Sarasota site would be comfortable with us using it as a model site? Or do you think we need to build a dummy site that we use as our model site? \nGary Daniels:\nWe can use TAMP. We can use FACP. I mean, it's totally fine with that. Perfect. \nTy Phillippay:\nAnd then you brought up something I hadn't thought through, but I was thinking if, like, the optimal state structure would be the storefront. Is housed on the State Association site. And then, if needed, if needs be, There was a mechanism to capture which sub chamber each group that was quoted came through and we were metering it at the state level. But what do you think, Gary? I mean, how many of these sites? For larger states, if there is concerns about commingling, you know, monies with the state or whatever? \nGary Daniels:\nYeah, I don't think we want to do that. I think we just want to do it. For each individual chamber, and, you know, Matthias, it didn't take. Once the structure is built, it doesn't take them long at all. Yeah, it's a template, it's more about getting the high resolution logo. I mean, we're doing this for two other associations right now, um, that want an association relationship with us at batch. Um, I think that the ones in Alaska and ones in in Montana, some nonprofit association in Montana. So they're not hard to ramp up to be, really, it's pretty easy. It's just a digital front door that's already been built, it's just a logo presentation. \nKyle Sexton:\nAnd what about, uh, and what about the domain? is it a thatch domain? or is it where? how does the domain get generated? Is that on your? Yeah, okay, and um, well, what? What are the assets as a part of each of those sites that have to live on your site? \nGary Daniels:\nHonestly, I'd probably have to have a discussion with, like Matias or somebody else on our technical team. A lot of the reason why we try to have it within our site is because. That becomes the first intro and the first beginning of the quote process for people that want to self quote. And so what we didn't want people is to linking out to different tool sets. And again, when you have to link out versus having something that's built natively within kind of our own in-house domain set. You create breakages and when you're building, the way he explained, it is like when you're building 30, 40, 50 of these sites, it just would be too much for our team to keep up with. \nKyle Sexton:\nIs the quoting process the same? \nGary Daniels:\nYep. \nKyle Sexton:\nIs the pricing the same state to state? \nGary Daniels:\nYep. For all the chambers, it'll all be the same. Because what we've done is we publish our small business pricing because philosophically, we want to be transparent with small business pricing. And so the chamber price will be 20% cheaper than that. \nKyle Sexton:\nOkay. How much of the education process needs to live on your domain? \nGary Daniels:\nIt doesn't. We have all kinds of different ways education has been facilitating. We have what we refer to as a version of that's for Brokers, which is like a broker portal to go in. And we have education that's already outdated. Neither here nor there. There's all kinds of different ways that we can facilitate it. In fact, one of our partners was working through our explainer video. And actually, we put it out on YouTube specifically so that they could go grab the explainer video and build it into their sites. But we're starting to do more of that work to allow people some nimbleness about the brand. \nKyle Sexton:\nIs the quoting tool also embeddable? \nGary Daniels:\nNot yet. \nKyle Sexton:\nOkay. One of the things I think is going to be helpful is the sooner that a chamber can put out information and education and campaign materials under their own flag. The faster this will go, even. And so what I'm envisioning is that I could actually help facilitate that for each of the chambers. That come on and have and kind of build out the, you know, the process. And where they come to the Thatch site for quoting, But everything else is really co-branded up to that point. And that would, you know. Probably take a significant load off any perceived bottleneck from your team on your side in terms of building out microsites. I don't want to make any promises, but I'm betting that I could probably crank out microsites faster because of my automation platform. I literally could have a member, a chamber, fill out a form and upload their logo and have the site up and live based on that. \nGary Daniels:\nYeah. Well, let's get Matthias on a call. He's the one that's been building all of these. And you guys can pull your technical heads together to see what makes the most sense. To be able to scale and to do things, again, right away from a branding perspective. Because what I don't want to do is ebbs and starts of strategy and tactics. I would rather just have them get go and stack hands and let you run for a year plus and see how it goes. \nKyle Sexton:\nOkay. \nTy Phillippay:\nDo you want to be in that meeting with Matthias, Gary, or can that be one that Kyle and I do without you? \nGary Daniels:\nYou guys can do it without me. It's whatever you want to do. \nTy Phillippay:\nKind of keep you involved, but also give you some space. All right. \nGary Daniels:\nYeah. \nKyle Sexton:\nOne of the questions I'm going to get from chambers right before they pull the trigger is when will they receive compensation from Thatch for all that they have done? So you said $5 per. Employee per month, paid annually, how does that work? \nGary Daniels:\nYeah, so what we do is, and this is an area, it just has to be manual if we have to pay differently. What we're trying to guard against, because this has happened quite a few times, where employers go out and get ICRA, they get health insurance, they sign up for a short amount of time, and then they bail off the platform. And so we're trying to guard against some of that a little bit. And granted, it's becoming less and less of a problem now that it's becoming more mainstream. And so the way that we'd originally set up these, these plans is that we would accumulate on, again, five dollars per employee per month. So, say they add 10 employees times, five times 12. That would be kind of their annual payout for just those 10 employees. Obviously, the more scale, the more employees you get. But quite a bit more that we pay out in terms of the PEPM component, we were going to do that on an annual basis. If that becomes a sticking point, which sometimes it does for a whole host different relationships, we definitely can have a structure that's quarterly or semi-annually. We just got to be able to have some runway. Um, to, to do those manual payouts. \nKyle Sexton:\nOkay, okay, that sounds good. Um, it's not that they're going to, I don't really anticipate an objection. It's just that they need to know the answer to that question because the board treasurer is going to ask that as well. And they're going to be in the room when they decide to go forward with this stuff. \nGary Daniels:\nSo, yeah. And I will be building a white paper here over the next, I'm probably not going to release it until January around. All of our learnings on this direct to employer strategy, Because I think that's really important in the sense that a lot of uninsured, a lot of folks from multiple states. The other thing I'll be able to share with you is state by state, kind of how this data played out, because that also might be a good talk track for you as well, in terms of the numbers of employers that came to Thatch on a state by state basis, looking for health insurance that came to us on a direct basis. That could be through their chambers. I mean, we got California. California, we had 91. Florida, we had 61 employers come to Thatch on a direct basis. So it's some pretty good data. \nKyle Sexton:\nYeah. \nTy Phillippay:\nAnd then what was I going to say? Keep going. \nKyle Sexton:\nWhat do you consider a sale when you get a signed agreement or a business bank account? \nGary Daniels:\nWhen we actually get members enrolled. \nKyle Sexton:\nOkay. \nGary Daniels:\nYeah. \nKyle Sexton:\nAnd will that be the same, as far as I'm concerned? \nGary Daniels:\nWhen you, yeah, as soon as we get an agreement with an employer and the billing signs, then, yep, that'll be the, that'll be the payout. \nKyle Sexton:\nOkay. And a chamber, what are they signing when they agree to do this? \nGary Daniels:\nUm, yeah, we're just going to do a, a boyfriend, cause a referral agreement just makes it super easy. They're like a one and a half page document. \nKyle Sexton:\nSo, okay. \nTy Phillippay:\nSo another thing, Gary, this is more in your world. Um, savvy brokers, especially these super small brokers, will figure out. I'm going to buddy up with the chamber and then I'm going to try and get my name on as many of these as possible. Or we'll just write one organically. And 60 days later, the broker's like, what do you mean? That's my case. When can I get added? So my preference would be that if a broker's involved from the beginning, that's great. And then I think we have to have some window of a well-intended. There was a breakdown, but like, then there's an ironclad. You can be the broker next year. Or something along those lines, to keep these little tiny brokers from just kind of vampiring alignment, or what do you think? \nGary Daniels:\nYeah, we've had multiple discussions about this on this exact situation. Um, and yes, what? The stance that we've taken is that there's a broker from the beginning will absolutely pay them the referral incentive and not change the pricing. We always want to make sure that we take care of the customer first. Foremost, that's going to be kind of the philosophical approach, um. But what we've been saying is that if something comes in 30 days after the fact. And they weren't aware they weren't a part of the process, then no. They're gonna have to wait until the next cycle until we attach them, and what? \nKyle Sexton:\nwhat does the next cycle look like? is that a 12 month cycle? \nGary Daniels:\nYeah, yeah, because we we've had more so on Neo than anything else, and it's interesting when we do. Like the the deep dive with employer, we've actually had brokers reach out to us and say, Hey, we. I've heard that my employer group came direct to that, usually because the employer was asking them questions around Icra and they were protecting their Blue Plan, or whoever their group relationship was, and said, Yeah, you want to do Icra? It's too hard, it's not the right fit for you. And then they go out and they do this quote and they're like, Wait a minute. This was super easy and this is intuitive, I understand it. I give my employees money. I just went that hard and they enroll with us, and then, you know, 60 days later, we should know. Or an email. I've had some nasty gram discussions with brokers and it's like, Well, you were so connected to this group that I didn't know that. They came out and quoted, enrolled. And then you're sending me an email 45 days after the fact, Um, no, you're clearly not doing it. It was best on behalf of the customer. If we have a broker that just got in late and the customer's like, oh yeah, I want to make sure that they're a part of this process, we'll definitely pay them. \nTy Phillippay:\nAnd we won't entertain the inevitable requests to become the broker of, because I'm sure there's multiple brokers who are on the board. They'll catch wind of all this. And that I think totally works against us and creates even more problems and is totally defensible, but that'll come up. \nGary Daniels:\nYeah, the broker of the chamber plan or whatever. \nTy Phillippay:\nThat's not what we're going for. \nGary Daniels:\nYeah. They can still be the broker, but they're not going to get an override on all the sales. It's just not the way we operate. That's too much cost at the end of the day. These small employers, it's so crazy. Kyle, you think about if we charge, let's just say the fee's 30 bucks, right? And it's an employer that hasn't had health insurance, or maybe they've barely had. On and off health insurance. And they go to shop and they can buy a $300 bronze plan, and we're 30 bucks, that's 10% of their total cost. And then the broker comes in and they're like, well, I want to add my 30 bucks. And then the general agent is like, well, I want to add my 30 bucks. And then we're looking at 90%. This is literally like a reoccurring question. It's like, guys, we're at 30% of total plan costs because you guys want commissions versus like, is this the right thing to give this three-person group health insurance? \nTy Phillippay:\nIt's like, because it's ridiculous. Wow, yeah, so we, you know, and there's another way, like, we got to capture that energy, Kyle. And the way we're talking to people where we're not anti-broker, we're, but we also I. A big thing I've been talking about is the new model. We're a different model of how you can get benefits in place for your team. Oh, and by the way, we give them more flexibility and we help you protect your budget. And you know, like, we can. We get to define what the new model looks like, but I think we want to be thoughtful in that because we haven't mastered that yet. So I'm interested in your thoughts. And especially as we get going, as your creativity kicks in, that's going to be really helpful, too. \nKyle Sexton:\nYeah. OK. I have a broker related question, where Kyle is the broker. OK. You've already got an agreement in place with FACP. The how does how does that work? When I go talk to Florida chambers that I know. How does that work? \nGary Daniels:\nYeah, so it can work two ways. One, the group can quote by themselves, which I doubt they do. I imagine they're going to come in through the broker relationship with us at FATS, through our broker distribution team, and say, hey, here's my quote. And oh, by the way, I want the chamber pricing. It's going to be associated with the Sarasota Chamber. We pay the broker. We make sure the chamber gets attached. We make sure you get attached. It's pretty simple. Okay. \nKyle Sexton:\nOkay. \nGary Daniels:\nWhat we're guarding against is this way after the fats stuff. Or even more concerned about. \nKyle Sexton:\nOkay. I have some speaking engagements coming up in Wisconsin and Michigan. Is there anything where I'm doing some small room, but big group trainings just for chambers? Is there any reason that I wouldn't try to use those opportunities to capture chambers for thatch? \nGary Daniels:\nNo. Absolutely not. What I'll do is I'll get this agreement finalized and sent over to you. I know we had some back and forth on it. I have to go back and see which one we were kind of thinking of tying on. But don't let that slow you down. We'll get it done. And then, yeah, you'll be off and running. \nKyle Sexton:\nGiddy up. Awesome. Ty, can you connect me with any and all marketing materials that you guys have used with any existing chambers up to this point? \nTy Phillippay:\nAre you going to make fun of them if we do? \nKyle Sexton:\nI'm not going to make fun of them. \nTy Phillippay:\nAll right. All right. That's good. Yeah. I mean, some of it's homespun. \nKyle Sexton:\nIt's all copy, right? It's just like we got to have the words in there. \nTy Phillippay:\nYeah. I mean, you'll immediately start to recognize some ways that we can position things. I think that's the unique value. \nGary Daniels:\nAnd if there's things that you want that are unlocked, let us know. We can just tell our marketing team like, hey, give us the unlocked version of either the PDF or the doc. They operate in all these platforms. platforms. I don't understand what they are. They're all creative stuff. But just let us know, and we can totally either unlock it. Or you can mock something up. And even like a simple kind of word format and say, like, Hey, I saw this PDF, or I saw the stock. This is what I like. I want it in this kind of word context. And then we can produce you some copy if that's what you want to do. It sounds like you like to build your own stuff, but we can go either way. \nKyle Sexton:\nYeah, it's not so much that I... Like to build my own stuff, it's that I know what chambers are gonna ask for. Yeah, and if we can just create that in advance and syndicate it, then Gary does the same stuff. \nTy Phillippay:\nI do the same stuff. We're totally aligned and that's we want, we want that. I think I've been, I've been picking that up, yeah, cool, and then the other thing just really quick, like Gary, this is tearing my brain apart and we'll talk about it more. But like, we have a chance to say we're different than insurance, or we have a chance to limp along for three years, saying, well, we're mostly like insurance, and it'll be this insurance light sort of thing. So if our average group size that we're going after, call it three or four, is probably even. That's probably year, two or three once we're up and running. It's more going to be the onesies, twosies. If there's a message, you know, we could say the U.S. Government has made a sweeping change to help the struggling small employers. You know, like we don't have to follow the Thatch hymnal, exactly. We want to really resonate with the chamber. So don't put it, don't put, I guess, an artificial feeling like this has to be insurancy on yourself. I would say, at any turn, if we can make something more. Plain English versus insurance speak, we got to go main Street, plain English, and then obviously have deeper. Materials available that have all the explanations and things like the handbook that the employer would get, we could make available as well. So just as you're kind of getting your voice and thinking about, you know, that would be one path. \nKyle Sexton:\nThat's how I'm thinking about it, Ty, in terms of before that gets introduced, like, we need people to be problem aware. \nTy Phillippay:\nYeah. \nKyle Sexton:\nAnd then solution aware, and then brand aware. \nTy Phillippay:\nAnd so the thing is, most are problem aware that, you know, most already are. \nKyle Sexton:\nYeah. \nTy Phillippay:\nSolution aware, not so much. I think that's really where we are going to be exiting or kind of morphing into their life. \nKyle Sexton:\nYeah. Yeah. So I already have a flow already sketched out, you know, it's problem aware and then Icra awareness and then thatch and then. And then how that delivers benefits to your members, and then how your chamber can distribute and benefit that content. And those agreements, how they can facilitate those benefits. Then q&A about how your brokers can. Benefit. And then the information about this is what your employers are going to ask for. That's the that's the workflow that I have. \nTy Phillippay:\nYeah. As soon as you're ready to share stuff, you know, you and I can maybe even get to a point where we had had it shared on the same spot and we could both tap in and added thoughts and comments. I figure we do that over the holidays and then we get a little bit more thatch expertise put in after you. And I have kind of gotten it to phase one. \nKyle Sexton:\nYeah. \nGary Daniels:\nOkay, sorry, I was trying to find this to send it to you. \nTy Phillippay:\nAnd then the other thing. There is marketing dollars that are available. As you know, of good, uh, calendar points where we should make a strong showing, call those out as soon as you start to see them. So we can, you know, it might be Gary sometimes when it works for his calendar, more often it would be me or anybody else. But I mean, those are where we want to be. We want to be at the ones where you feel like matter the most. And also we'll go to the, if there's a strategic reason, you know, we will go travel to the sticks. \nKyle Sexton:\nI have two of them that you can put on your calendar right now. One of them is called MACE, M-A-C-E, Mid-America Chamber Executives. It's held in the beginning of the first week of May. Also, in the first week of May, in a different part of the country is... MACO, M-A-K-O, is Missouri, Arkansas, Kansas, and Oklahoma. These are both multi-state chambers. They're multi-state chamber Exec associations. They are very influential. The third one I would put on your calendar, Ty, is WACE. That's in February. I think it's first or second week of February. It's probably in California, Vegas, Oregon, or Washington. \nGary Daniels:\nWe were trying to get in with him for a while. \nKyle Sexton:\nWith WAC, yeah, how's that? How did that go? \nGary Daniels:\nUh, I just met with. I'd actually sent in a more of a generic request to sponsor one of their events and then no one got back to me. And then, like, two months, three months later, some lady reached out. She's like, Oh my gosh, I completely missed this. We'd love to have you. Can you be here next week? I was like, No, let's get back together. The first part of the year, uh, so I think the conference, I want to say, it was like somewhere really. Fall was the one I was trying to get into. \nKyle Sexton:\nOkay. \nGary Daniels:\nBut yeah, we'd love to get in with them. \nKyle Sexton:\nI think that's their, I think that's their policy conference or their leadership conference. You want to go to, you want to go to the Big Conference anyway, that's in February. \nGary Daniels:\nAnd then we need to think about. For some of these, can you like, roll up a couple of like sponsorship opportunities and shoot those over so I can start to budget for it? \nKyle Sexton:\nYeah, I can do that. Uh, and then the other one I would put on your calendar is, um, in July is ACC. Uh, it's gonna be in New Orleans and that is gonna be so hot. And yeah, you're not gonna want it like it. Don't go outside. \nTy Phillippay:\nWhat's tearing up to you in July? \nGary Daniels:\nYeah, all right, is that the is that an American? \nKyle Sexton:\nThe Association of Chamber of Commerce Executives, that's the big dog. These are all, these are all, all the chambers. Like Sarasota. Okay. \nTy Phillippay:\nYeah. \nGary Daniels:\nCool. \nTy Phillippay:\nAwesome. All right. So the partnership paperwork will be forthcoming, but we'll expedite that. Thanks, guys. Yeah. I figure you and I should maybe get to a point, maybe just right after the holiday. Where we just book, have a meeting twice a week that's standing, and then just start passing stuff back and forth. When is your first trip? It's not before it's January that you have your next trips, right, Kyle? \nKyle Sexton:\nYeah. \nTy Phillippay:\nOkay, perfect. \nKyle Sexton:\nYeah. Yeah, I'm pretty quiet until mid-January. \nTy Phillippay:\nAwesome. Great. All right. \nGary Daniels:\nGreat. \nKyle Sexton:\nThank you, guys. Very good to see you again. \nGary Daniels:\nYou too. \nKyle Sexton:\nTy, thanks for sticking with it. I'm glad you survived. \nTy Phillippay:\nYeah. \nKyle Sexton:\nI noticed you haven't shaved since I saw you in the first part of October. \nTy Phillippay:\nYou know, actually, it's a marker. I've been trying different styles. Yours just makes me feel inadequate. So I've been growing this for about seven months, though. Pretty blood. Gandalf. You got the Gandalf thing rolling right now. \nKyle Sexton:\nI know. \nGary Daniels:\nAll right. \nKyle Sexton:\nThanks, guys. \nTy Phillippay:\nBye, guys. Bye-bye. \n",

            "transcript": "Joseph Firenzi:\nHello. \nBarbara Kettman:\nHi Joseph, how are you? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nGood, how are you guys doing today? \nBarbara Kettman:\nGood, thank you. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nIt's great to hear. But cool, yeah, I would love to dive right in. Sometimes these meetings actually get down to the wire a little bit in terms of having enough time to get to all the material. So I'd love to just get to it. My name is Joe, I'm on the business team here at Thatch. And before. Before I get too much ahead of myself, I did want to ask if this is your first interaction with us, or have you spoken to other representatives at Thatch before? \nBarbara Kettman:\nFirst time ever. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nOkay, cool. \nBarbara Kettman:\nSo, yeah. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nAnd then it looked like this is going to be a virgin group. Is that correct? With no previous benefit solution? \nBarbara Kettman:\nYeah, I'll let Carla answer, because she's the one that's most familiar with this group. Okay. \nCarlaGatlin:\nI have to remind myself the group. \nBarbara Kettman:\nSanchez. \nCarlaGatlin:\nOh, okay. Yes, it was a merchant group. They did already make a choice for January. So I think that's all. We just want to know how that works for any upcoming new groups. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nOkay, so Sanchez is all taken care of, and they don't need a solution. Did they go on the Government Exchange or did they go with another third party Icra administrator? \nCarlaGatlin:\nYeah, they're going to do a regions plan through us, through the carrier group site that we used. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nOkay, cool. So, for the purpose of today's session, I'll just be outlining how Thatch functions. \nCarlaGatlin:\nPerfect. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nOkay, cool. Thank you. That's helpful. Neat. Well, I would love to just give my standard slide deck presentation that I give to... Employers and stuff as well. And then I think that will be very helpful. And then, if you'd like, afterwards, I can show you our allowance calculator, which is how the employers decide on the monetary amount to distribute to the team. Want to pause here, though, because I wanted to see if there was anything pressing. If you guys had. That was top of mind that I could address first. \nBarbara Kettman:\nNothing I know of. Right. \nCarlaGatlin:\nI just I assume this is very ICRA. So lots of information that my brain needs to hone in on. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah, of course. Well, cool. I'll just start with the presentation here. And then, if you have any questions along the way, feel free to interrupt me and then I'll take a second. But can you guys see this? Yes. Perfect. So this first slide kind of just highlights how that functions in comparison to the traditional group insurance model. Basically, the employer would go out and choose only one to three plan options with the standard model, But because people have different healthcare needs and different, you know, backgrounds, locking them into just a few different plan options might not be the best path forward. One of the many cool things about choosing an IcRa plan on that is that. You will present the option for your team members to choose any plan in the Zip code they live in. The average amount is about 40 in any zip code in the United States. And, you know, in certain areas, there's actually well over 100 different plans to choose from. So that means not only the employee will be able to find the best plan for themselves, but also the best plan for any potential dependents that they add as well. And then, at a high level overview, this is how Thatch is going to function. So at the top of the screen, there is an example of that monthly allowance that you can distribute to team members. This will be pre-tax for the business, of course. So that's very nice there. And for the sake of this example, we'll call this individual here Stacy, and we'll just say that she works for you. You'll send an invite email out to Stacy, saying, hey, we're going to use that this year. Please accept the monthly allowance I've designated for you and create an account, which only takes about five minutes, And then go on our Plan selection page and choose any plan that you like best. Stacy goes and she does just that, but the plans she ends up choosing is only $500 per month with that medical premium. Which means she would have $250 left over monthly. With that leftover $250, she can actually spend those dollars in a very similar way to an FSA. At Thatch, we call those leftover funds qualified medical expenses, and some examples of ways that you can spend those dollars are on things like prescriptions, therapy, dental costs, and many other items that the I.R.S. has deemed to be qualified. You are required to enroll in a plan. Before accessing these leftover funds, which means it is not an option to decline healthcare coverage and then only have the FSA pre-tax spending account with us. These funds that someone could have in surplus after choosing a plan that costs less than the allowance do roll over month to month throughout the entire calendar year, so people can save them up. But if at the end of December, any employee forgot to use their leftover dollars, their balance will reset to zero. And then in January, they can start saving them up once again. These funds are not pre-distributed to the employees, which means that they always just sit in the business bank account awaiting an eligible transaction, which also means if they got unused, those funds would just remain in the business bank account because they never left. And then going to the bottom of the screen here, this is the thatch card. So this is just going to be the most efficient way to spend those dollars that someone could have in surplus. There is both a digital and physical version of this card upon request, But people can also use a personal payment method if they would like to, and then upload the transaction onto their Thatch portal for reimbursement. With those pre-tax dollars there. Then, going back to the top of the screen, we can now flip the script and ask the question, what happens if Stacey chooses a plan that's $850? So now it's $100 more than that monthly allowance she's receiving. In this instance, Thatch will sync with your payroll provider and then automatically withdraw that $100 from the employee's payroll, which does allow Stacey here to cover a cost-sharing scenario with pre-tax funds as well. So that means thatch is pre-taxed both for the business with that initial allowance distribution, and pre-tax for the employee. In the instance that they choose a plan that costs more than that allowance. I know I'm moving quickly here, so I want to pause and see if you guys have any questions so far. \nBarbara Kettman:\nNo, good here. \nCarlaGatlin:\nI have a quick question. So payroll providers, if a client is pretty small and they do everything in-house, how does it work on their end? If they needed to set that up with you guys? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah, so you can do it manually. We will just track the amount that is supposed to be deducted and then that will reflect in the Thatch portal. And then you'll just go into payroll and enter that amount. And then you'll have the numbers on the screen right there that you can just plug in. \nCarlaGatlin:\nAnd if they do use a payroll provider, is there a cost for the feed to go over from thatch? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah, so there's no additional fee for using the two-way integrations that we have. Some of the examples of payroll partners that we're with that have that two-way sync are Gusto, ADP, Quickbooks Online, and a bunch of other ones. \nCarlaGatlin:\nPerfect. Thank you. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah, of course. Any other questions so far? Okay. So we are partnered with all the major healthcare carriers in the country. We actually have... Essentially, all of the same plans that can be found on the Government exchange, and all of the same prices as well. The two main benefits of going to Thatch are going to be the pre-tax dollars that you unlock by going to a third-party Icra administrator. So I'll just go back to this slide really quickly. Going back to that example of Stacey choosing a plan that's $850, If that same scenario carried out on the state Exchange or government exchange there, she would actually have to cover that $100 cost difference with post-tax dollars. So the pre-tax funds, there is something that's only available to third-party Icra administrators with that 125 cafeteria plan structure. The other major benefit of choosing Thatch over the Government Exchange is, of course, our robust tech platform. And I'll just quickly fast forward to this slide. So this lists many, but not all. Of the benefits that Thatch offers, we will make sure that businesses are staying compliant and they won't get dinged for anything. We assist with enrollments and cover separations, we help with receipt verification and official documents during tax filing season. We have a best-in-class support team that responds very, very quickly with any questions that might come up. And you know what this really means for the employers at the end of the day is they only have to worry about one thing one time a year. And it is coming up with that allowance amount for the team members, and then everything else is on autopilot. So we want to make it as easy as possible to roll out these great benefits. So employers can actually focus on doing the work that they do there. It'll go back here and then, you know, I know. With all these different plan options and the huge selection that there is. It can seem like a daunting task to present to team members, but after a few helpful filters and questions on the plan selection page, only about 15% of employees end up needing assistance. And if they still need help, we actually do offer live support. So there is a button on that plan selection page where they can schedule a phone call with one of our licensed benefits experts, and then they'll help them decide on a plan there. On top of that, we actually also have a very advanced AI chatbot, and it is custom tailored around benefits questions as well, and that is very, very helpful, too. And then this is the Thatch marketplace. So it's actually an extension of ways to spend those dollars that you could have in surplus after choosing a plan that costs less than the allowance. We're partnered with a number of different healthcare brands. A few examples you can see on the right hand side there. And these have all been pre-approved by the IRS to be qualified medical expenses. So if people save up enough of those pre-tax dollars month over month, they can certainly purchase these items if they would like to. And we actually have several discounts with these brands as well. And our marketplace is growing essentially by the week now because of our partnership team. So it's pretty neat. We'll call out, though, that this really only comes into play if you do have a surplus of funds, which means if you choose a plan that costs more than the allowance you're receiving, you'll just have to opt for that pre-tax payroll deduction, and then you'll be covering a cost difference for the health care plan instead of having a surplus here. But cool, those were all the slides. Feel free to ask any other questions right now, But I'm going to pull up our demo environment so I can show you how our allowance calculator functions. \nCarlaGatlin:\nI have another question. How does it look for the broker side for commissions if there's 15 different carriers that were selected? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nSo Fash acts as the broker of record, and then we give you a PEPM fee. A per enrolled employee fee of $30 per person monthly. \nCarlaGatlin:\nDoes what does onboarding look like? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nUm, yeah, so I'm gonna share my screen. I'm actually gonna show you what the onboarding process looks like for smaller businesses. Excuse me, my account segment is actually just um accounts of 10 lives or less. And this is the flow that I use for those sized accounts. So I essentially give the same presentation that I gave you guys. Then I send them a link to use this calculator, which can be found in the self-service onboarding process. And then they can self-service the rest of the way and then invite employees within the same day. It's an incredibly fast process. We have very talented software engineers that design this to be as easy as possible. But I will say for larger groups of 10 or more, there is a bit of a different flow, and that's going to be a little bit different depending on how that works there, but we'd be happy to set that up for you guys as well. But anyways, so employers are going to move forward. Eventually, they'll hit this page and they'll upload their census data. I have a fake census here that I will drag and drop. And then for these two fake employees I created, we have Max, who lives in San Francisco, California. He's 25, with no dependents. And then we also have Olivia, who lives in Austin, Texas, who is 45, with a spouse and a child. So I'll move forward and I will call out why those details are important in just a second. You'll choose your start date here. So I'll do that. And then eventually, you'll hit this page. And there's two main ways you can go about your allowance strategy on Thatch, or for any third party ACRA administrator, I should say. The first of, which on the left hand side, is a flat allowance for everyone. So you could give everyone on the team the same monetary figure. In this example, it's $900 each. But if we look at the bottom of the screen, we can see the costs of their plans are actually very different. And the reason for that is that the insurance carriers price the plans based on three details, which are going to be their age, the Zip code they live in, and the number of dependents they have. And with those three details, the costs of the plans fluctuate drastically, which is why this person in the middle has such a higher price tag than her colleagues next to her. On the right-hand side, we are looking at Thatch's dynamic calculator, And you are allowed to give people a different allowance, but only if that different allowance is structured off of age, Zip code, and number of dependents. Sometimes people ask me if you can tier allowances based on job title or seniority at a company, and that is actually considered non-compliant. Because it doesn't have anything to do with how the insurance carriers price the plans, and these are pre-tax dollars, so there's some rules around them. But I will show you the calculator now, and this is what it looks like. So with these default settings here that we can change, this is what the two employees would be receiving. Again, Olivia is older and has two dependents, which is why she'd be getting more than twice as much as Max. here, because this calculator is mirroring how the insurance carriers price the plans. Before I play around with the inputs too much, we'll just click See plans next to Olivia, which is one of the coolest things about this, because then we can get a look at the buying power that we're giving her. Right now, at these settings, she'd be getting $15.41 each month. There's 90 plans available to her in Austin, Texas. And then we'll get a look at these plans. So right now we're seeing some plans with a green number. We'll look at this one in the middle. Granted, it's a very high deductible plan, but this is just an example here. And this green number means the entire cost of this plan is covered in full by the current allowance. And then she would actually have a surplus of $254 each month that she could then spend on those FSA eligible items, such as prescriptions, therapy and stuff like that. Now I will go back up and filter. By gold and silver plans here. Well, actually, it's two gold. And now we see plans with a red number. So now it's the opposite. This plan is not covered in full by the entire allowance. And then she'd have to do a pre-tax payroll deduction of 143 each month. So this is a very, very valuable tool for the employer to dial in that allowance strategy. And get an understanding of the cost sharing on a per plan and per employee basis here. And again, you can change a bunch of these inputs up top until you get something that you're happy with. In the top right, it shows the total monthly cost of the business. So it's going to add together these allowances and then also factor in the fees to use our platform, which will be $45 per enrolled employee per month. If you have someone that goes on a spouse's plan at a different business, you will not be charged that fee for them. And they will also not receive the allowance, which means not a single dollar will be spent on them. And then again, you receive 30 of that 45 as the referring broker there. And then there is also a $50 monthly compliance fee, but that is flat at $50, regardless of headcount, which means if you have two people on that or seven on that, that's still 50 per month. I want to take another pause here and see if you have any questions. \nCarlaGatlin:\nI have another question. So you're showing a monthly. That cost, like in red a second ago that we could see, how would we be able to see that on a per paycheck? Or is it always going to be due on the first of the month, like a normal premium? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nSo are you asking, like, when the payroll deductions would take place? \nCarlaGatlin:\nYes, to show, because this is showing the per month. So is there a way to show it, you know, per payroll, what those deductions would be? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nSo right now, we don't have the flexibility to like, divide that by two, for example, like if they're paid every two weeks. But when you're actually setting up the account, you can choose the payroll period of, you know, like every two weeks. And then it will deduct accordingly. Okay. Yeah. Any other questions so far? \nCarlaGatlin:\nSorry, one more, and maybe you'll get to it. But on wired and Roll, which is where this batch is that we found, right? We don't get to see any of this. We just kind of put in information for the group and then we would be given a sales rep that kind of we hand off to. Is that how it's always going to work? We'll never get to see and build out plans. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nSo we actually have partnerships with many brokerage firms throughout the country, some of the largest ones in the nation, and also some smaller ones as well. I think, you know, this was kind of like an experimental thing with the Wired. quotes. And I think if you wanted to, you could certainly reach out to our team here and actually set up a formal partnership with that if you wanted to. And then you could send quote requests for any group that you get in touch with. And then you would basically work with me or another rep to close business and then get that 30 per enrolled employee per month referral bonus. So if that's something you would like to do, I can give you the email address of the appropriate. Person to reach out. Yeah, I guess. \nCarlaGatlin:\nOutside of that, would you suggest maybe have to like Thatch.com? Like, how would we? Outside of getting this set up as a broker, what would be the steps to have that option with you guys? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nUm, sorry, I just want to ask for more details before I answer to make sure I'm understanding correctly. So, um, are you asking, like, how to access what I'm showing you now, or how to submit quotes, or how to submit a quote? \nCarlaGatlin:\nIf we had a group, Virgin or renewal that we wanted to be able to provide this to. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nOkay. So you would have, like your own login credentials, where you just enter your email and password. Then you'd have your own like broker side of the Thatch website that you would access. And then you would submit a form there. And then that form would trigger a workflow within our system. And then it would be assigned to the appropriate representative there. And that's kind of how that would work. \nCarlaGatlin:\nAnd that's very different than if we were a broker on the Thatch side. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nOh, no, I was highlighting how it works on the thatch side of things. So if you were submitting a quote, you would follow the steps I just highlighted. \nCarlaGatlin:\nOkay. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah. Did you want that email there? \nCarlaGatlin:\nYeah, I think we would like that. Let me. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nI can send this in a follow-up email as well. Okay. So just, oops, that did not work. There we go. So it's just going to be chad at thatch.ai or thatch.com. Either one works, but he's actually the head of our broker partnerships team. And he has relationships with many, many brokers throughout the country here. Yeah, you can just shoot him an email. You can include me on the thread and say, yeah, we had a presentation with Joe. We're interested in partnering. We'd love to get a formal presentation on how the partnership would work and stuff like that. \nCarlaGatlin:\nPerfect. Thank you. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah, of course. But yeah, I would love to highlight a few other details. You can, of course, do the same dollar amount for everyone if you wanted to. That's where you do this up top. The main concept to keep in mind, though, is that concept of buying power. So, for example, if you gave $550 to someone that's 26, that's going to buy a lot of rich gold plans in full for them. But if you give that same $550 to someone that's 45, that's only going to cover a small portion of of richer gold plans, which is why the dynamic calculator makes the most sense in almost all instances, unless you have a demographic or census, that's going to be very similar in age or something. or, you know, same zip code as well. And then some of the other inputs you can change here. So you can adjust the allowances at the dependent level. You can choose 0%, which would be asking the employee to cover the entire increase in cost that comes with adding dependence to their plan. Or you can help them out financially and choose to support the increase in cost that comes with dependents. You can adjust the allowance amount based at the employee level. You can do lowest cost, which will base the allowance off of higher deductible, less expensive plans. Or you can do better benefits, which will base the allowance off of richer, lower deductible plans. You can also hit this custom tab and then really dial in the amount to what you're happy with. So you can move this slider and then we'll see the numbers move in lifetime until, you know. You reach something that you're happy with there and you can see what the total monthly spend is going to be as well. So it is a pretty powerful tool, from what I've been told. Other third-party Icra administrators don't have anything like this, and it's pretty easy to use. And then again, we can look at the prices on a per employee basis. I wanted to show you, Max, because his plans are going to be much less expensive due to his age and not having any dependents there. So, with an allowance of $697, he'd have gold plans covered in full, with a surplus even. As well, which is nice. But yeah, I think I got to a bulk of the content here. Oh yeah, I wanted to call out, I guess, that. Once you send the first invite email out to employees, The allowance will be locked for the year, which means employers cannot go in and change the allowances in the middle of the season. Also that the first time someone switches to an ICRA, or if they are switching from a group insurance plan to an ICRA, it does trigger a special enrollment period. Which means people can sign up on the first of any month throughout the year. But the important thing to call out there is that Icras actually always function on a calendar year basis, which means the 2026 plans will start on the 1st of January. That also means, hypothetically, if someone started on November 1st of 2025, their new 2026 plan would start on January 1st, two months later, Meaning, if they chose a plan with any kind of deductible, they would only have two months to pay that off. So ideally, you want people to start earlier in the year. So they do have more months to pay off a deductible, if that makes sense. And then in terms of, sorry, I'm just trying to think of all the details that might be important to you guys. So sorry if I'm rambling, But if you run into a group that does have a previous solution in place, so a group insurance plan with a rate, and you're looking to do a cost analysis, we actually have a pretty advanced cost analysis flow that we do as well, where we can take the deductible and out-of-pocket max from that renewal rate and plug it into our system. Then we make the assumption that everyone on the team would choose the closest similar plan on thatch. Then we run the numbers to see if Thatch would save them money or if the group insurance plan will be more cost affordable. In terms of what deciding, what decides which is going to be more cost affordable, it really just comes down to the census. Data relating to age, ZIP code, and number of dependents, as well, of course, as the... Renewal rate that they got from their current quote there. \nCarlaGatlin:\nI have a plan right now that has a terrible increase for January 1st. They switched their plans. They have very limited networks to where they are in our state. They're bigger than 10. So I probably wouldn't be able to work with you on that group. But I would love to see a cost analysis because they begrudgingly moved to a worse plan than they had. But. They want us to keep shopping for them. So can you just kind of reiterate if all plans are starting 1-1-2026, But they could essentially get off their group plan for a 2-1 or 3-1 start looking. And everyone can kind of, based on an analysis, can choose if the group plan is still going to be the best fit or not? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nSo, yeah, they could do that. If they wanted to, as long as there's no restrictions on exiting that plan, they could certainly do that. But yes, we could. Give that cost analysis and see what that would look like if there is flexibility there. The thing to keep in mind, though, is if they have a deductible on that plan and then they spent any dollars towards that deductible in January, that would be lost because they could not carry over the payments that they've made to that plan into Thatch, if that makes sense, because they would be choosing a new health care plan. Yeah, that makes sense. \nCarlaGatlin:\nI had a question that I exited my brain. So if you just give me a second. Dang. No, there's no kind of underwriting where they look at health reasons why people can't have anything. It was just as simple as the Zip code, their sex and all of that, right? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah, it's not on health reasons. It's not on gender, I believe, either. It's just age, ZIP code and number of dependents. \nCarlaGatlin:\nIndependents. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah, so the really cool thing is that instead of, you know, doing the underwriting based on one employment group. So let's say it's a group of 10 people at some company, they underwrite, evaluate details there. And because that. You know, group is so small, there's more risk, which is why they look into more details. With ICRAs, that group is actually based off of the entire state that someone lives in, so the state of California or the state of Texas, so you're really spreading out that risk pool, which is pretty neat there. And then I can show you some data that we collected, which is pretty interesting. The numbers here I'm about to show you are for all insurance renewal rates, so group and ICRA, But wanted to show you how crazy the increases are this year. So this column here is going to be the rate increases by state. With Arkansas, we saw a 46% increase, which is pretty wild. The average amount was about like 15 to 30. And again, this is for both Group and ICRA, But yeah, we ingested a lot of data here from all of the carriers and took the average. Percent increase. So hopefully we don't see this again next year. But pretty wild stuff. Because then essentially every three years, we would see insurance rates doubling, which is very much not ideal, right? \nBarbara Kettman:\n16 for Washington. That's pretty good. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah, yeah, some of them weren't too terrible comparative, but yeah, hopefully we don't see this again. \nBarbara Kettman:\nYeah, for sure, gosh. \nCarlaGatlin:\nWhat's the turnaround for an analysis? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nIt really just depends. This time of year, it gets pretty hectic during open enrollment. So some of the reps might be kind of swamped, but usually it's going to be pretty quick. We try to get back to you as soon as possible. And then after, like, you've done, you know, the first one and you've had. Like, a cost analysis presentation. If the if Ichra or Thatch ends up being much more costly or it just doesn't make sense, the reps will probably just disqualify it. And mention that in an email instead of asking for time on your calendar. Perfect. \nBarbara Kettman:\nThat's great. I'm sure, Carl, you and I are thinking of the same thing, I'm sure. \nCarlaGatlin:\nYeah, I'm sure. \nBarbara Kettman:\nYeah. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nBea, I wanted to call out as well that the final day to... Enroll in a plan is coming up here for a January start date. That's going to be, you know, ideally the 22nd, I think, or operations teams. I think not to Christmas, though. But then after that, anyone enrolling would start February 1st. You can start on the 1st of any month, like I said, if you are switching from group insurance to an ICRA, Or if you don't have any solution in place at all, of course, you can sign up on the 1st of any month. We do ask that people enroll by the 25th of the month prior, just to give the carriers enough of a buffer to process all the details and information. One more follow-up question, really quick. \nCarlaGatlin:\nSay there was a surplus of money, if they had a $700 allowance and their plan's $500, that $200, Using the same platform, can they choose dental, vision, life? All of those ancillary products also built into this same system? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah, good question. So we do offer dental and vision right now. That's all we have, though. And that same allowance is going to be rolled into all three. So that means, hypothetically, if you spend your entire allowance that you're receiving from the employer on a health care plan. And then you still want dental and vision, you will just use the pre-tax payroll deduction method to cover that cost difference. But, of course, dental and vision are very costly. Dental is only like $40 to $80, and vision is usually $15 to $20, so nothing too crazy. Okay. \nBarbara Kettman:\nAll right. I didn't ask this earlier, But if they're looking at plans to pick with the different carriers, they can pull up the SBC and see what benefits are actually there that they can use. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah, so I'll send you a link right now. One second. So this link here that I'll send in the chat, if I can, there we go. So this one's more of an employee facing public search tool. I'll share my screen to show you how to do it really quick. You guys can bookmark that and use it as much as you want, but I'll just input my information really quickly. I live in Austin and do that. I don't have any dependents. And if I had dependents, I would enter that. But then I can immediately get a look at all the plans and accurate prices in my area. So there's 90 plans in Austin. And then let's say, I really, oh, this is actually the plan I'm on, funny enough. So I click this, we'll click Plan details, and then it opens a new page. And then right here, we can click Summary of benefits. \nBarbara Kettman:\nOh, wonderful. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nIt downloads it as a PDF. I will say the other very cool thing, I'll just sort by, I'll do gold and silver. You can checkbox up to three of them. So we'll just do the first. \nBarbara Kettman:\nOh, for side by side. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nOkay. And then on that, you have this nice, really clean looking table with the different numbers and stuff here. \nBarbara Kettman:\nThat's nice. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah, it makes it a lot easier to visually digest. Yes, for sure. \nBarbara Kettman:\nI like that a lot. Yeah. Okay, that's good. \nCarlaGatlin:\nWould you suggest, if we were thinking of talking to an employer about possibly offering an option like this, that we would just send over this hyperlink to thatch.com? Forward slash plans. So that they can kind of see for themselves how easy it would be for a quick view for their employees to look at? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYou could, if you want to. That is available on our public website. So it's not like it's some private thing. I think the thing that, you know, like our leadership team, worries about. If people try to go too much of the self-service route is the amount of confusion that can come because of all the moving pieces within ICRA. I think, you know, health care plans, as it is, are very convoluted with group insurance. For sure. There's this new Icra thing that just came out like five years ago. And people are like, I don't know what the hell is going on. And from my experience, that is what happens quite a bit. But, you know, I'd say, go for it if you want to. Definitely. You know, send it over their way and say, like, yeah, this is what the prices would look like, have your team look at it. There's more plan options available. You can say whatever you want there, but yeah. I'm happy to send other resources as well. We actually have a pretty large library of stuff in our blog here. And if you just type in thatch and then a keyword, so something that people ask me about are eligible classes. So I typed in thatch eligible classes on Google, and then we can find this, which is actually another. Interesting detail, and I'll send this over. But it just outlines how you can glass people out based on different items. So, for example, you are not required to present an icra offering to part-time people if you do not want to. If you do want to, you could create one flat allowance for all full-time people. Let's say it's $700, and one flat allowance for all part-time people. Let's say it's $300, so that's another option. This is just an example of a resource that we have that outlines stuff like that, But we have a pretty robust compliance team that makes sure people are following the rules and stuff like that, and we have a bunch of other useful stuff on our website. \nBarbara Kettman:\nI lost the screen. Okay. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nWell, yeah, feel free to reach out to Chad if you would like to. He's going to be the head honcho there for our partnerships team, and you can drop me on there. \nBarbara Kettman:\nYeah. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nAs well and say, like, yeah, we're really interested in partnering. We want to, you know, see if we can, you know, get set up with our Thatch brokerage accounts. \nBarbara Kettman:\nYeah, I'm pretty sure we will be doing that. And then I will probably reach out to you to find out who to contact regarding this other group that we're thinking of. \nCarlaGatlin:\nFor cost analysis. \nBarbara Kettman:\nRight. That's what I'm thinking. So yeah, for probably, like, a March 1st, I would think. And they have no problem the first two months because of the fact they know the situation they're in. So they're open to any suggestions we can give them. And I think this might be a great option. So, yeah, so we'll definitely be in touch with Chad to see what we can get set up. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nOkay, cool. \nBarbara Kettman:\nSo, okay, cool. Well, yeah, that sounds great. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nFeel free to loop me on that email with Chad. And also, if you guys have like any questions for me, feel free to ask those on a different thread. And so, yeah, feel free to use me as a resource as well. I would love to call up any way I can. \nBarbara Kettman:\nThat's great, Joe. Thank you so much. Thank you so much for your time and information. We appreciate it. Yeah. Okay. We'll be in touch. It was a pleasure meeting all of you. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nI hope you had a great day. \n",

Hi. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nYeah, we're kind of matching today. \nRetsy Holliday:\nWe are. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nName planet. \nRetsy Holliday:\nWe just start coordinating outfits for all of our goals. Like, what? No, we didn't. We didn't talk about this. We promise. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nThat could really be great areas for bonding with random prospects. What do you think of under overs with this lady showing? \nRetsy Holliday:\nShe did apologize to me. I'm opening up my desk. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nThat's crazy. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, got an apology. I don't think she's worked with us before. Let's see, IAG. I guess IAG is decently big for us, right? I should look in Salesforce real quick and just see if we've done anything with her before. I also need to ping. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nDo we have a good history of that? I never look at Salesforce. \nRetsy Holliday:\nIt's, you can see, like, what opportunity. Okay. Yeah. That, actually, she has two other opportunities other than this one. Oh, one, one opportunity. I always forget the first one is like her learning about that. It looks like. This other one, why does this keep happening? I keep getting notified, it's like, illegal something in salesforce. I'm like, whoa, what? why is that language being used in salesforce? That's, it's alarming. Um, it doesn't look like Jesse's assigned this one to anybody yet. Um, this, um the other op. She's working, so this might be the first time that she actually talks with that. She's just submitted two quotes for us, but it just reminded me I need to ping Jesse because our friend Danielle has a two-life group, and it's unclear as to whether he has looped anyone in. I'm like, dude, I need you to be real responsive on that. Because we need to bring L.J. Rogers in by 2-1. Let's show, like, let's roll out the red carpet for Danielle. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nI will refrain from giving my real thoughts. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYep. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nDanielle's incredible. She deserves a red carpet. She's a very good partner to us. You are very logical. You should reciprocate. Exactly, do not disagree. Oh, Danielle, I feel like we need to do like a side debrief with her. \nRetsy Holliday:\nI know I know Jesse was like, she's not responding to me over email, and I was like, Oh, yeah, she doesn't. I've learned that very quickly. So I just call her phone. Yeah, I now I, and now I have her number saved, and she just calls me whenever she needs something. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nYeah, that's the most effective way. And then to, really, depending on, I don't know, I'm assuming she's organized, but depending on how frantic she is, the recap emails. Yes. Like, no, we did talk about this. I could pull up our call log, or I could just make it really easy for you. Yeah. \nRetsy Holliday:\nUm, you see the thread with Casey and Chris about home life? \nKaitlin Zidar:\nNo, I will look at my email. \nRetsy Holliday:\nThat's hilarious. Also. Um, yeah, Casey said. They're playing around with different scenarios. And that they should make a decision tomorrow on whether or not they're moving forward or not. And like, yeah, the way that he, he said, it was like, they're literally just playing around with, like, cost share. Like, it sounds like that was a done deal. It sounds like it. I'm not knocking on wood, but nothing needed. Can't wait to talk after that. But yes, he, one second, Jesse. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nHe's a good partner. You're just really winning over the USI team. Is he on the same office as Greg or different locations? \nRetsy Holliday:\nShe is. Taken care of because we to pull. Okay, thank you so much for doing your fucking job. Um, sorry, he Casey is um Oregon usi um, and Greg's where is that, Greg? Chicago? So I'm winning over the coast. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nThis is great, I can't wait for you to travel. \nRetsy Holliday:\nI know, me, too. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nYeah, you have a very differentiated pipeline. Oh, you might not be able to keep Casey. \nRetsy Holliday:\nI know, I know. I wish that would be, well, we'll see. Also, I was like, Chicago is central, right? I mean, they're at the central time zone. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nI'm so removed from any of those decisions. \nRetsy Holliday:\nIt's not a map. It's always interesting when you start carving things up because. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nOh, yeah, when Level did this. This was after I moved to Texas, right? So you're gonna get the West territory, and I was like, Okay, but I'm in Texas, right? Yeah, Texas, isn't it? I was like, what it's like, are you telling me to move to San Francisco and are you paying for that? \nRetsy Holliday:\nOr like, Yeah, they're like, Well, we did it. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nWe looked and like, all the contacts you would have in Texas are all San Francisco based companies anyways. I was like, that's not true. \nRetsy Holliday:\nI love when people spin that, right. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nYeah, I was like, Um, I don't know how you're doing that, Matt, but okay. \nRetsy Holliday:\nI have to take a screenshot of this right now and send it to you because I can't, seriously. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nThis is going to be good. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOh, God. How's your dog? \nKaitlin Zidar:\nIs she behaving? \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, she's good. It'll be interesting because we, it's the last two, the last two messages in that thread. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nThis morning earlier, I was talking to Joe about, like, what his wife does and she works in non-profits. So I'm like, Yeah, you know, I'm really grateful. I'm involved in one and I'm meeting different people and they are very kind. Sense of urgency really varies. He was just laughing. He's like, What's this? what's your non-profit people's backgrounds? You know, it's just very different. And then very humbled, but I'm like, maybe I'm the insane one, I don't know. Joe Joe, who? Oh, he's one of our engineers, he's awesome. \nRetsy Holliday:\nSee I? uh, I live in like my own little bubble over here, without like from Engine product. And let's see, is this from her? Nope, Um, yeah. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nWhen you moved to Austin, you'll be in the bubble of like people that come to the office regularly. And then you see familiar faces and you have a nice banter in the morning, then you go your separate ways when all your meetings start. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, that would be nice just to I was gonna go down to, um, Denver for the they're having a yeah. And now I like, my husband is going down for an interview. And I was just like I. Timing wise, it wasn't working out. And so, and I honestly, like, after being down there last week, I'm like, I don't really want to travel and there's supposed to be a snowstorm tomorrow. So like, Yeah, am I? So I was like, you know, I'm like, but the people on that invite? I was like, man, like, I don't know any of these people. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nUm, so, you need them, but I need to. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, I need to make an effort of meeting more people outside of our little go-to-market bubble. Um, I did, let's see. \n",

KEY POINTS DISCUSSED\n\nPrimary Business Drivers\n- Cost Management for 2026 Renewal: Tim expressed significant concern about insurance premiums increasing \"thousands of dollars every year\" and noted that \"2026 is not faring well\" for cost projections. The company is seeking alternatives to control escalating healthcare costs.\n\n- Administrative Burden Reduction: Tim highlighted the complexity of administering traditional group plans, particularly around:\n  - Annual plan selection decisions for employees\n  - Compliance requirements (described as \"scary\" with \"steep penalties\")\n  - Cash-in-lieu-of-benefits administration (described as a \"nightmare\" due to post-tax complications and government regulations)\n\n- Employee Empowerment: Tim wants to \"put more money in the employees' hands\" rather than giving it to insurance companies, preferably through pre-tax vehicles like HSAs or similar mechanisms.\n\nCurrent Benefits Situation\n- Current Carrier: United Health Care via Simply Insured through QuickBooks Online (QBO)\n- Enrollment: 10 of 12 employees enrolled\n  - 1 employee opted out due to high costs and found cheaper individual coverage\n  - 1 employee covered under spouse's plan (city government employee with excellent coverage)\n- Integration Requirement: QuickBooks payroll integration is \"super important\" to minimize paperwork\n\nICHRA Solution Interest\n- Plan Customization: Tim appreciated the ability to customize allowances based on age, location, and dependent count without needing class-based structures (which require 10+ employees per class)\n- Plan Variety: Impressed by 162 plan options available in their Florida zip code\n- Pre-tax Benefits: Strong interest in the Thatch card/HRA for leftover funds to be used pre-tax on qualified medical expenses and marketplace vendors (mentioned interest in Oura Ring, HIMS, telehealth options)\n- Cost Transparency: Values the ability to see comparable plans and ensure employees won't pay more under the new structure\n\nConcerns & Special Situations\n- Employee Communication: Tim worried about \"scaring employees\" with the transition, particularly those with young children. Wants to ensure proper explanation that they're \"still getting a traditional plan\" just purchased individually with reimbursement.\n- Cash-in-Lieu Alternative: One employee (covered by spouse) seeks compensation for not using company benefits. Tim explored whether ICHRA could address this but learned the HRA requires purchasing a medical plan first, and funds expire annually.\n- Change Management: Tim researched alternative options including HealthShare and wants a gradual transition approach.\n\n2.

Check-in Communication (Around January 7, 2026)\n   - Follow up closer to enrollment deadline\n   - Ensure Tim is ready to move forward if decision is positive\n   - Address any outstanding questions\n\n3. Employee Presentation (If requested, before January 24, 2026)\n   - Conduct demonstration for all Point of Light employees\n   - Explain ICHRA concept and how it works\n   - Answer employee questions to build credibility and trust\n   - Help with change management concerns\n\nSecondary Considerations\n\nFor Tim to Explore:\n- Research FSA options for employee covered by spouse (not Thatch-related but mentioned as potential solution)\n- Determine if maintaining a small traditional group plan alongside ICHRA is necessary (though likely not needed based on conversation)\n\nThatch Platform Actions:\n- Employees will have January 7-24, 2026 to select plans\n- Employees can access AI-powered plan recommendations or speak with Thatch support specialists\n- Plans will be active February 1, 2026\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES\n\nPricing Structure\n- Platform Fee: $45 per employee per month\n- Compliance Fee: $50 per month (flat fee)\n- Total for 12 employees: Approximately $590/month in Thatch fees (plus allowance amounts)\n\nTechnical Requirements Met\n- QuickBooks Online payroll integration available\n- Self-serve platform with guided support\n- Automated payroll deductions for employee contributions (if buying up)\n- Receipt verification and reimbursement handling included\n\nCompetitive Advantages Noted\n- 100+ plan options in Florida (162 in their specific zip code)\n- Smart allowances avoid class-based restrictions\n- Pre-tax HRA for leftover funds (expires annually, similar to FSA)\n- Thatch Marketplace for telehealth and wellness products\n- End-to-end compliance management\n- Locked annual budget (no mid-year premium increases)\n\nRisk Mitigation Strategy\n- Tim wants employee presentation from Thatch to build credibility\n- Emphasis on explaining this is still \"traditional coverage\" just individually purchased\n- Concern about cost comparison to ensure employees don't pay more\n- Gradual transition approach preferred (\"baby steps\")"

It was great learning more about Point of Light and your goals for benefits.\n\n\nHere's a quick recap of what we covered:\n\n- ICHRA allows employees to choose from 162+ individual plans in your area (way more options than traditional group plans)\n- Smart allowances adjust budgets based on age, location, and dependents to ensure fair purchasing power\n- Leftover funds go on a pre-tax Thatch card for qualified medical expenses (prescriptions, telehealth, even Oura rings!)\n- QuickBooks integration is ready to go\n- Your budget stays locked for the year - no surprise premium increases\n\n\nNext Steps:\n\n- Play around with the quote calculator to find an allowance structure that works\n- Check out available plans at thatch.com/plans\n- If you'd like to move forward for a 2025-02-01 start date, aim to sign up by 2025-01-07\n- Let me know if you'd like me to do an employee presentation\n\n\nI'll follow up early January to see how things are progressing. Let me know if any questions come up!\n\n\nBest,\n\nTaryn"

            "transcript": "Taryn Livingstone:\nHello, Tim. Hello, hello. \ntlinamen:\nHow are you doing? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nHey, I'm doing good. How's it going with you? \ntlinamen:\nDoing good. Hey, we're out in the park. Hold on. We're going to get a camera here. If you're going to show your camera, we have to. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOh, my gosh. Amazing. \ntlinamen:\nWithout all the other employees listening to us and everything else. So, Kayla. Helps me with all of this admin stuff that we're doing. And we just were interested in looking at alternative options because we just see our insurance plan jump up thousands of dollars every year. And we're like, this is getting old. So we wanted to kind of look at what different options were. And I ran across that and thought, let's set up an appointment and see what it's all about. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOkay, perfect. Yeah, that sounds wonderful. Other than the park, where are you calling in from? What area of the country? \ntlinamen:\nCentral Florida, basically. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOh, Central Florida. Oh, nice. Okay. I'm actually headed to West Palm Beach area next week for the holidays. My family lives there. \ntlinamen:\nOh, that's wonderful. Oh, that's great. It's a nice area. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah. \ntlinamen:\nYeah. I know. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nExcited to be on the beach soon. I'm right now in New York, so I'm very much looking forward to it. \ntlinamen:\nI'm sure you are. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOh, yes. Oh, yes, indeed. But anywho, all right. Well, wonderful. It's good to connect. And also, so I noticed, I was going to say, you guys are at 11 employees, right? Is that right on the size? \ntlinamen:\nWell, counting me. I mean, technically, I'm an employee as well. So, technically, 12 counting me. 12. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOK, nice. And then, as far as benefits go, what does participation look like? Do most people, are they in it? Are they not? \ntlinamen:\nMost people are in it. We have two, I believe, that are not. One, it started getting, the cost started getting out of control, and she was able to get a cheaper plan on her own. So she already kind of moved out of the group plan. And one of the other employees has her own coverage through her husband. But that particular employee also has been asking about cash in lieu of benefits, which is a nightmare from a keeping track of it. And, you know, it's just a nightmare from a standpoint of just trying to administrate it. And make sure also that you're complying with the government regulations. That's the biggest thing. I was surprised at how complicated cash in lieu of benefits is. But it's such a hassle that, you know, I was looking for something that might be a good hybrid that would cover potentially cover that option as well. And I don't know if, you know, the plans that that has, you know, covers that through HSA or something along those lines. But that way, it's pre-tax dollars, because cash in lieu of benefits is post-tax, and it's. Very restrictive and everything else. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nSo, yeah, exactly, yeah. And we'll be talking a lot about pre-tax dollars on this call. Actually, what's your own familiarity? I know you just mentioned you, you just kind of came across it bro. Do you have any familiarity with, like, how it works? \ntlinamen:\nUm, I've done some research into how it works, yes, but there's some areas where you know. Just like everything with insurance, it gets kind of complicated and in some cases, all the different options that are out there are. Sometimes they start mixing together. Wait a minute. Can you pair an HSA with that one or not? You know, so I'm starting to kind of lose track of which things are which I have to keep looking it up and trying to remember what things, you know, how you compare the different things. Gotcha. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOkay. Yeah. \ntlinamen:\nPrimarily ICRA, right? Isn't that what you guys are primarily? Yeah. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah. You got it. We actually only do ICRA. So we are a full icra provider. And yes, I'll kind of cover what that looks like on our end in just a second. But, okay, this is all super helpful information on my end. I think very last question, actually, and this is just going into, I know you mentioned that, obviously, cost is a big concern. Anything else you're looking to accomplish with benefits or anything else you want to learn from this call? \ntlinamen:\nI mean, really, the goal here is not just to save cost. I mean, I'd like to put more of that in the employees' hands. You know, administering. The plans, and sometimes for us deciding every year what's the best plan for our employees and everything, because we get a mix with. You know, our coverage is through United Health Care, and right now we use simply insured through QBO. Quickbooks because it ties in very nicely, I know you have the ability to tie in with Quickbooks as well. Yeah, um, that's important for us, um. But it's really just to be able to either put more money in the employees hands. Whether it is able to go into an HSA or something like that, where it just gives them rather than giving it to the insurance company. At least in the traditional way we are. That's why we're looking. I mean, I've looked at a number of different alternative insurance options, including HealthShare and other options out there as well. But again, the Stats website was very organized, was very, you know, I like going with companies where it feels like they're going to be there for a while. And it's, you know, maybe it's baby steps in moving the employees to a different direction, because that's one of my biggest concerns, is. Scaring the employees to say, we're going to move from a traditional normal group health care plan to something a little bit different. I know some of my employees would love it. And I think some of them might be a little bit scared. You know, the ones that have children, small children and things like that, they're going to be thinking, wait, wait, what's what's going on. So we want to crunch some numbers on our end and make sure that we're not costing our employees more by switching to something like this. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nTotally makes sense, too. Okay, perfect. Yeah, in that case, what we'll do. So here's how we'll do the call, then I'll give you the rundown on thatch. You can, of course, please ask me as many questions as you'd like regarding ICHRA, how it works, all that good stuff. And then I'll show you how to do a quote with us. So we actually are, we're a very transparent company. We let people come in and make their own quotes, and I'll show you how you can actually do that. And so you'll be able to not only see what the cost would look like, but also see exactly what plans employees would have to choose from, too. Wonderful. \ntlinamen:\nAnd that is something with this. One of the questions I had was. The employees would have to buy a traditional insurance plan through Thatch, right through the Thatch marketplace, they can't go outside of the Thatch marketplace for their own plan. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nSo yes and no. So the way it works is they need to choose an individual plan, so Icra very long acronym stands for individual coverage Health Reimbursement arrangement. So, yeah, like five letters. But it means that, um, they need to pick a plan that's individual. Which means they either will do a plan that is on exchange, meaning the ACA, or off exchange through Thatch. So we honestly our our marketplace of plans, which is off exchange. Because we go directly to the carriers very much mirrors what is on the ACA, sometimes even there's more than what's on the ACA, given that we're just again sourcing these directly from the carriers. In Florida particularly, we have like, over 100 plan options, usually for most Zip codes, so, um, there's definitely a lot of optionality there. But if they wanted to, though, if someone had a plan on the on the marketplace that they were in love with. They could also import that to Thatch. That's an option that we also have. So that is something that they can do. \ntlinamen:\nOkay, good, good. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, you got it. All right. So, all that being said, I will pull up my slides and then we'll run on through it. So do you see this right here? \ntlinamen:\nSure, do. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nAll right, perfect. So to kick things off, at Thatch, our mission is to build a healthcare system people love. So how do we do that? Well, right now, generally speaking, the way that health insurance works for employers, specifically small employers, is. You would need to pick one carrier with one to three plan options that suit everyone and make everyone happy. The issue is kind of twofold here. First off, if you did have anybody who maybe wanted to see a particular doctor. Or they're coming from a different network and then are looking to join your company, that usually will mean they'll have to switch out of the care that they already have. Also, if you do have a small group. And then someone happens to be a bit more expensive that year than the rest of everyone else, everyone's premiums are going to shoot through the roof. Across the board, which you may be familiar with. So basically, it makes this one size fits none scenario. That just is a very poor fit, again, especially for small companies. So that's where we come in with an ICRA. So ICRA, I know we just covered this, it being an individual coverage plan. So that means that you as an employer. Would create a budget for each employee to then spend on their health care by first buying a medical plan. And then with any leftover funds, right? So, say, in this case, this employee bought a plan that's $500 with a $750 budget. That can be used similarly to an FSA, where anything that is a qualified medical expense can be purchased. So there are more traditional things you can buy, like prescriptions, copays, CVS, go grab some Advil, whatever have you. But she can also, in this case, she bought a HIMS and herS membership, which this is a telehealth vendor. So there's actually, like a lot of more interesting ways that people can now use those health care dollars to buy products and services that will help make them better. So, yeah. Any questions on how this works? \ntlinamen:\nAnd then that where you have the thatch card, is that like the? Is that like the equivalent of a health savings account, or is that just. Are there limits on that amount of money that can go into that card? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, it's a great question. So this is a health reimbursement account is like what it's technically called. So how it's different than a health savings account is the employees can't contribute to it. So what's here is the leftover of the budget that you gave them. \ntlinamen:\nOkay, that makes sense. That makes sense. And that's really all I was trying to do was to find a way that we could, that additional money is something that they can still use for their health care. For anything that comes outside of the norm. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah. \ntlinamen:\nA video that said, I'm sorry, Taryn, I don't mean to interrupt. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOh, go ahead. \ntlinamen:\nWasn't there a video where it said the HRAS don't follow the employee, only the HSAS do? Is that? Well, it wasn't. It was. And that's why I don't know. I mean, that's what they basically said was that, you know, the difference is, is that the savings and everything fall into the employer versus the employees, which NHSA does. But I mean, I think it must be how they're handling this account, because they're still administrating and everything. So technically, it's still, I don't know. I mean, it must work. They're advertising. Yeah. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nSo to answer your question there, actually, that is a good question. So basically, with this dollar amount, you can almost think of this as you're incentivizing employees to spend more on their care proactively versus saving for down the line. So in that. So what this means, too, is that this dollar amount. So, say, this employee saves fifty dollars a month. Month over month, um, at the end of, you know, six months. She's now gonna have 300 to spend. At the end of a year, um, that remaining dollar amount would actually expire. So it is, that's how it's going. \ntlinamen:\nI see, yeah, I see, got it, yeah, you got it. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nSo similar to an FSA, um, in in that regard, where it does expire with this bug, with this model. Yeah, another thing to mention here, actually. So this dollar amount you see is pre-tax, so I mentioned we would cover that this is a pre-tax dollar amount. So employees are able to access this and then pay for their health care without paying taxes on it, which is kind of nice. And another thing there, so say that this employee actually spent $1,000 on their plan. They just decided to buy the top of the line plan in their area. Their contribution, if they're buying their plan through thatch, so in that case, $250 to make up for what's missing here. To make $1,000 would also be pre-tax. So both employer and... \ntlinamen:\nOh, okay. Okay, good, good. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYep, you got it. All right, definitely a lot on this slide. But yeah, I wanted to make sure we cover all of that. So now actually, to dive a little more deeper into this piece here, so the medical plans. So for any given area, and again, Florida is one of our best ones. We usually have around 100 plans to pick from. But on average, we'll have around five carriers with 20 plan options. So basically, we're giving more optionality for employees who are getting their healthcare sponsored by their employers than they've ever had before, which is great. But with optionality also means we need to make sure that people are feeling supported and selecting the plan that's going to be best for them. So that is, once again, where we come into play at Thatch. So we are first and foremost a tech platform. So we'll take into account information like who someone's doctor is, if there's a particular provider that they want, to make sure there's a network for them. Also, any medications, whether they want to spend a little bit or a lot on their plan, really any information like that to recommend the plans, that would be a best fit. And then, similarly, though, if they also want to skip the AI and just talk to a real human, We have a whole team of support specialists, actually, who are dedicated plan advisors. So they can actually help and compare plans with people as they're talking through what they're thinking for what they want to do with their health care. That year. \ntlinamen:\nOK, great. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nAll right. And then. All right, so now jumping over to Thatch Marketplace. So this is kind of going back to that concept of having these leftover spending dollars. Where traditionally, if you have an NHSA, FSA, Usually it comes down to those things where, like, at the end of the year, you're like, oh, I have some leftover money. I guess I'll buy contacts and band-aids and whatnot. We decided, what if we actually made a way for people to access really great, high-end care through Thatch itself from a telehealth perspective. And so. Everything you see here, or all the vendors you see here, are people that we've actually partnered with to list their products on our marketplace. So you might see some familiar faces, like Peloton or Ring. It's a bit more fitness-oriented. \ntlinamen:\nI've seen HIMS, and I've seen H-Sleep, too. Oh, yeah. Our Ring. I've got an our ring right here. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOh, there we go. Boom. Amazing. Yeah, well, hey, you could be paying for that with pre-tax dollars if you want to, right? Interesting. Cool. \ntlinamen:\nIt's cool. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, yeah, it's very cool. \ntlinamen:\nNow they can only make it where you can buy your Apple watch because it has health stuff on it. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nHonestly, I wouldn't be surprised if there's anything about this right now. \ntlinamen:\nI mean, it's becoming more and more of a health band, anyway. I mean, really, it does tell the time and do other things, but they're catching up with doing health coverage, you know. Yeah. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOh, yeah, they're definitely getting there. I mean, they're competing with all the other wearables. We actually just put whoop on our platform too, so, like, they're all good. They're all competing together now in the marketplace. It's kind of funny. Yeah, definitely fun. So, anyway, another added benefit. \ntlinamen:\nThat is kind of a cool idea for you to be able to use that money that is being left over. Yeah. And still have it be pre-tax. That's cool. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nRight. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, super cool. All right. Very lastly, this just covers the nuts and bolts of it. So, in total, you can think of Thatch as an end-to-end medical benefits platform. So we will handle everything from getting all of your people enrolled in their plans through to compliance. As you mentioned before, compliance can be super hairy, but we handle everything. \ntlinamen:\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's the biggest part with all of this is the compliance end. It's scary. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, it definitely is. \ntlinamen:\nSome of the penalties, they're steep. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYes, indeed, they are steep. Yeah, there's a lot of checks and rules to follow, but we thankfully handle all of that with all the legal documents that we provide. So not the thing that any of our employers have to worry about. All the way through to receipt verification. So, like, say, you end up going and buying some prescriptions on the go, use your credit card, You can just take a picture of the receipt, upload it to Thatch, and then we would reimburse you if you have any of those funds left over for that. So we also handle the reimbursements there. And then. Yeah, very lastly, payroll deductions we already covered, But that will come into play if you have an employee who buys up and buys a really expensive plan where they would also contribute. We integrate directly with most payroll providers. Which one do you guys use? \ntlinamen:\nQuickBooks. Oh, yeah, that's right. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYou mentioned you use QuickBooks. \ntlinamen:\nYeah. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOkay, perfect. Yeah. So quickbooks was actually, actually, I think quickbooks was our first ever integration. So we've been partnering with them for a while now. \ntlinamen:\nGood. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah. Yeah. But anywho. \ntlinamen:\nThat's super important to us. We don't have additional paperwork. Easier on ourselves. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, definitely. I know we definitely try to, you know, eliminate the paperwork, but, like, quite meaningfully, most of what we do is pretty automated. So yeah. All right. But that's basically all I have for you in terms of the overview of that and Icarus. Any, any questions on, like on how this works? Anything works? \ntlinamen:\nI think so. I know you said you were going to show us how to do our own quote. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nSo that'll be all right, perfect. Yeah, I'll jump on over into this. Oh, no, I spoiled the surprise. Wait, let me go back. Okay. Okay, here we go. All right. So we'll start on this page. So what you're looking at here is this is the page that you would actually get to. If you just go to thatch.com, click Start now, it will take. Oh, did you go through that, or? \ntlinamen:\nI don't think I went all the way through. I got where it showed me, like, the estimated monthly cost. And then we kind of just started chatting about costs from there. And I don't think I ever moved forward. You just did it. What? This is something we've been talking about, something that she does. And she just said, I was like, I had, I told her, I said, next time you do it, I'm going to tell you. I think it's cute that she does it, but I was like, I have to, I have to point it out. Anyway. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOh my gosh. What amazing. Well, so actually, you kind of already went through this. So I'll just, I'll just cover it really briefly, though, so that you both have eyes on how this works, but. Basically, this is a screen you would get to if you did what you did and signed up. And so what you do first is put in your employees. So you can do it manually, or you can upload a list. I usually recommend manual if you have like just a few employees, though. It's a little easier to do that way. Go next step and it will show you a little census here. All looks good to me. We're just using San Francisco as an example. So I'm just going to click through these screens to get to here. OK, so. This is outlining the two ways to do allowances. So the first way to do it is the same dollar amount for everybody. Very straightforward. Everyone gets a flat amount. The only issue that this can cause, though, is. You might have someone who is a bit younger, who simply can get way further with their health care dollars than someone who is a little older, right? And so that's where we have a smart allowances calculator, which basically will take into account where someone lives. How old they are and how many dependents that they have to recommend. A dollar amount that is going to give them the same purchasing power as the people at the company who have different needs. So to illustrate what this actually looks like, though, hop on into here. Okay, perfect. So we are starting off on the same dollar amount for everybody. So if I scroll down here, you'll see that. What I can do here is set a budget, so let's say I set 500 as the budget for everyone at my company. One thing I can do that is going to give a little bit of different amounts, even though this is the flat way of doing it, is I can set a budget for a dependent. So let's say for first dependent, I'll give an extra $100 to get in, and then for any additional dependents, we'll give $100 per dependent, right? So what that's going to do is for anybody with multiple dependents, they're going to get a higher dollar amount than people who have less dependents. So that is one way you can do smart allowances. It can be, or... Or allowances, I should say, can be a little bit hard, though, to actually know, like, oh, is this? Is this a reasonable amount to cover this person or that person? Which is why we'll do smart allowances over here. So with this, just to walk through what it's showing us here. So coverage level, you can think of lowest costs, like a bronze plan, Best Fit silver Plans, Better Benefits, gold plans. And then dependent coverage at 50% also means that you'd be covering dependents halfway. So, but I will say, a better way of doing this, actually, So, once you select which level of coverage you want, if you go over to custom, this will actually let you get a bit more granular with it. So, say you want to contribute 80%, you can slide that around, and it will actually adjust the allowance amounts down here as well. You can also say dependents 100%, that'll adjust it, too. Yeah, a lot of different ways to slice and dice it. And also, like, to give another way of what this 80% figure means, it basically means that if for your employees, who you're looking to give, Or I should say, offer everybody a silver plan level of coverage, and for that, you will cover 80% of it, basically is what that means. Okay. Yeah. \ntlinamen:\nThat makes sense. One of the things that's interesting is I like the fact that you can customize it based on the individual, because one of these I had read is that you could customize based on classification, but you had to have at least 10 people that were within each classification to do, that was part of the rules. And I was like, well, how can you do that? We've only got like 12 people. That means everybody's in the same classification, except for two of us. So I'm not sure how you guys are handling that there, but maybe that was also an older rule that I was not, you know. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nNo, you did do your homework correctly. So classes do come into play. The thing is, that only is going to matter if they don't have a compliant calculator. So the calculator we have here is actually avoiding the classation piece, because classes will usually come into play if you're classing based on something. Such as full-time, part-time, salaried workers. If you're basing it on the three parameters of age, location, dependent count, that's when you can actually offer custom amounts. \ntlinamen:\nOkay, cool. That's great. That's good. That's nice. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, it is. It's definitely, definitely quite nice there. Yes. Okay. And then, Oh yeah, I almost forgot to show you, of course, for any, any person, we can see what they see. So if we click on View plans, this is going to show us, for instance, for Bob Smith, right. You'd see not only, so you could, you could look at plans that are, so for instance, this one is going to be in a more expensive plan. Because it's a silver PPO. Right. So for that one, he'd be paying some out of pocket. But if he decided to buy down, so to say, and then bought maybe a bronze plan, Because let's just say Bob Smith is 35, pretty healthy, doesn't really have any need for any fancy plan this year. He might buy down and then have some extra dollars to spend on an oral ring or whatever. Right. \ntlinamen:\nSo, yeah. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nGood for Bob. \ntlinamen:\nHe need at least two to three months, based on that. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, exactly. So. That is how that all works. \ntlinamen:\nIt's actually really nice that it shows it to you. And because that's what we were just talking about. I was saying, I want to make sure that we're not making the employees pay more by switching to a different system. And I was like, we would want to look at what is the current plan they're picking? What is the comparable one on the marketplace to go? Will they be saving money or will they be spending more? Because I don't want to present something to the employees that is like, that looks like me just trying to spend less money. Even though I'd love to spend less money and give them more. Yeah. But the reality is, that's not why we're doing it. It's just, you know, you can, you can look at what's going on with insurance and you can see that. It just continues to trend up and up and up. And 2026 is not faring well. So, you know, and then even beyond, it's just going to keep escalating. So having some level of, you know, help with cost control and everything is good. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, exactly. And the great part about this budget, actually, too, is that once you set it, it's locked for the rest of the year, too. Like, it's not like. The only thing that will change it, of course, is, well, a couple of things. So, first off, if you have someone who, you know, is going to be on their spouse's plan and won't enroll, you can just simply uncheck them. That will change what the estimated cost will be. If you hire more people, it will go up. Right. Because now you're giving them an allowance. So I like to think of this kind of more like a. Budget than a quote, just because, like the nature of it is that it is kind of flexible. Even though once you set it, um, and especially once you set the allowance amounts, that those won't change. Um, so, yeah, and then, oh, yeah, almost forgot to cover our fees, so at thatch, we do two fees. First is a 45 per employee per month, so kind of similar amount if you were to work with a broker. And then the compliance fee that we charge is a 50 per month flat fee. \ntlinamen:\nWe'll probably be able to you whenever. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, there we go. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, so it's 45 per employee. Okay. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYep, you got it. And then, all right, let's see. Last thing else, I mean, I'm going to send you this also in a follow-up, But if you go to Thatch.com slash plans, this is actually a really nice way to spot check plans that are available in your area. So if I were to go to like Jane Doe and just make a fake employee here, and then what's a good Zip code for you guys? 33823. 33823, Florida. Check plans. All right. \ntlinamen:\nSo, oh my God, there's 162. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nThat's a lot. I just didn't realize we had that many in Florida. Cool. \ntlinamen:\nAll right. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nSo, so basically, there's many plan options and then what you can do is, so right now we have lowest deductible at the top. So these are going to be the cheapest plans with the highest premium. We can also do two is sort by lowest premium, which are going to be now lower premium plans, higher deductible. So you can also, I mean, again, we have platinum through bronze, there's everything from POSS to PPOs. So kind of a lot of ways to search and pick which plan people on. Also, HSA eligibility. So if you do have any employees with an HSA, you mentioned that that's something that they can take with them job to job. And so, if you just check off this box, you'll find plans that are HSA eligible, meaning that they can have a ICRA plan alongside an HSA, too. OK, so very last thing. Oh, yeah. Sorry. Go ahead. \ntlinamen:\nNo, go ahead. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nI was just going to say, if you did. Also want to see the details, clicking on Plan details, that's going to give you. Like the full like nuts and bolts of what the plan details are there. So great, also helpful tool. \ntlinamen:\nSo it sounds like, in reality, that doesn't have anything in place currently. At least it would help my one employee who's covered by her spouse that wants some kind of compensation for. You know, the fact that she's for not costing the employee money, right, right, right. She's basically just wanting to try and benefit from having the benefit that we're giving to the other employees. But she doesn't need it because her husband covers her. I've kind of explained it that, look, Mike. The goal as an employer is to just make sure your your people are covered and your people have insurance. And that you're blessed that your husband's got a great plan. I mean, he works for a city government, so he's got great coverage, um, but I understand the feeling that the other employees are getting this benefit, which is increasing the amount of money that they're getting from the company. And she isn't. So I'm trying to find ways of... Of satisfying that I was hoping to find it within the ecosystem of the, of what I choose to do. But it sounds like right now there isn't anything that we're really within the thatch environment. Because, I mean, because we couldn't divert all that money to just that card without her getting a plan. So. I mean, could we not? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, unfortunately. So the way with Nick, Nick works is you need to pick the medical plan before having access to leftover. \ntlinamen:\nAnd that's what I had read as well with it. Was that to? The downside. Now that I understand that the money on that card, that's what was interesting with that. So I'm like, okay, well, they've got the card, but it expires at the end of the year. So that means, no matter what, she'd have to spend all that money before the end of the year, or she loses it anyway. And that means we lose it, too. Yeah. So, okay, good. That helps. At least that's, I mean, that's a really niche thing with what we're doing with, you know, the employees. I just kind of hoped that I'd find a plan that would, or something that would help me wrap that, you know, put a little bow on that little. um, particular employee thing that I've got. Not that we wouldn't have an employee later that that was applicable to as well. Um, but, you know, still, that helps, that helps others knowing that. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, definitely. And, like, and that's something you can explore. I am not a hundred percent on this, but you may be able to also offer an FSA specifically for her. Um, I would look into that. Although, honestly, not my area of expertise. \ntlinamen:\nI should, I think you can. I mean, that's. One of the things we looked at with Icra, too, is the fact that you can still keep a traditional group plan as well as having an Icra plan. But at least that's one of the things I saw with the positives and negatives between, as a matter of fact, it's on your own website, the difference between Sarah and ICRA. Right. Was that with ICRA, you could keep a group plan. Not that we would need to. I'm just worried about a couple of the employees that I think might be a little bit more concerned about switching to and alter your plan. Not that I could understand why. I mean, I think if it's explained well to the employees and they understand that, hey, you're still going to get the same coverage. You're still getting a traditional plan. It's just you're buying it yourself and we're reimbursing you for it. So I think as long as it's explained that way, it's fine. Do you guys have any kind of an onboarding thing for employees? Like, do you like if we were to say, hey, we want to do this kind of little demonstration that you just did for us, for all of our employees? Is that something that that does? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOh, yeah, that is something I'm happy to do. So we do that basically on a, if you ask us, basis, we will happily do a little presentation there, yeah, to give you the overview of how it works. \ntlinamen:\nThat would be great. That way all the questions get answered. They're going to ask me a question. I'm going to go check on it. In addition, it just gives a little bit more of a, rather than me coming and saying, hey, we're going to switch you over to this new thing. It's great. Trust me. Not that they can't go to your website and explore it themselves and understand it, but it would be nice. I think a presentation gives some level of. Credibility to certain things, you know, and they see somebody from a company who's coming in and explaining it to them, I think it would be a little bit easier. Yeah. So awesome. Is there an enrollment period that we need to meet? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYes. I was actually just about to cover this last piece with you guys. Yeah, no, no, no. You're, you're, you guys are, like, so far ahead of me. Oh my gosh. Like every part, everything I know I'm going to talk about, you guys already asked a question about. So there's nothing else we haven't covered. Trust me, except for this. So enrollment periods. So. Right now, we are in open enrollment, which means that right now is the time where people are buying plans on the individual market. That being said, so two things, actually. First of all, are you looking for a specific coverage start date? Probably 2-1. \ntlinamen:\nYeah, 2-1. Because our current coverage goes till 2-1. 2-1, okay, perfect. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, in that case, we're not in any crazy time crunch for 1-1. So what it would look like on your end, then, is you would want to sign up for Thatch and invite employees to Thatch. By the end of the first week of January. So that's going to be like around like 1-7 or so. So a little bit of a time crunch, but not crazy. The reason why we have that in place is so that employees will have another two weeks before the last week of January. That way, they can actually look at plans, see what they want to do, and enroll before February 1st. \ntlinamen:\nYeah, that makes sense. Yep. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, exactly. And so, um, so that's, that's the timeline on my end. Um, as far as next steps go, I mean, you already jumped on in and started making your quote, which is which is perfect. So really, the next step there is to just simply keep playing around with allowance calculators. Check out the plan options. If you want, you can run things by employees again. Generally speaking, for most group plans, we can usually find a very comparable plan on the individual market. And it also, too, sometimes you might have an employee that has one doctor they like, another one that someone else likes, And they end up picking different plans anyway. But usually there's going to be a plan that's going to cover whatever their needs are there. So, yes, recommendation is to go in, play around with the calculator, find an allowance structure that you like. And then from there, once you're ready to go, you actually can just simply continue on and enroll yourself into that. So is fully self-serve from here on out. That being said, I will, I will still be a helping hand in terms of just making sure you guys are good to go, because obviously this is health care. So it's good to have someone like helping to guide through that process, too. But that's basically what it looks like from here on out. \ntlinamen:\nAwesome. Great. Well, thank you very much. Really appreciate it. Thank you. Very helpful. Very helpful to answer questions. Sometimes you can search on the web and then just... Go down a rabbit hole. And I know less than I knew before I started. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nNo, absolutely. Especially with, like, a lot of this stuff, like, there's so much nuance to it. And it really does depend on situations that, like, yeah, it definitely helps to, yes, have someone tell you what, what they have learned. And I mean, you know, yes, I've been working with many, many people over the past, like year and a half or so. So we are hopefully more, more aware of how the crew works that now than I used to be. But that being said, laws still change. \ntlinamen:\nSo yeah, all that being said, yeah. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nNo, I truly, But the great thing about obviously working with that, too, is that you do have the entire company in your back corner. And we're constantly working on, you know, moving it forward, all that good stuff. So, anyhow, it was great to be both of you. I'll follow up with an email with basically just the links I kind of talked about, but didn't actually send you guys. So you have all of that good to go. And then I'll also just follow up, probably a little closer to that. One seven timeline, just to make sure if you guys want to move forward that all is good to go from there. But all right. But in the meantime, though, have a great rest of your weeks and holidays. \ntlinamen:\nYeah, you can say, thank you so much again. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nAwesome have. A great one bye, guys. \n",

Key Points Discussed\n\n- Employer's Interest in ICHRA: The primary objective is to find affordability solutions to manage 2026 renewal costs while maintaining competitive benefits for a small team. The employer is facing rising premium costs in the traditional group health insurance market and is seeking cost predictability and administrative simplicity. The company has 3 employees, and the employer is exploring ICHRA to provide flexible, individualized health coverage with controlled employer contribution.\n\n- Cost Structure & Affordability Analysis: The current baseline shows employee Isaac paying $273.27/month out-of-pocket for a United Healthcare ACA exchange plan with a $3,000 deductible. The employer's initial preference is a 50-50 cost-sharing model for employees Aniyah and Isaac. Thatch's dynamic calculator structures allowances based on age, zip code, and number of dependents. Platform pricing is $45 per enrolled employee per month, with a $50 flat monthly compliance fee.\n\n- Coverage Details & Employee Situations: Eric Gilbert (Owner) will enroll with his spouse, while Aniyah and Isaac, both young and single, are open to catastrophic/high-deductible plans.\n\n- Plan Options & Buying Power: There are 47 individual health plans available in the employer's zip code area. Allowance flexibility allows employees like Aniyah to access plans with monthly surpluses for FSA-eligible expenses.\n\n- Additional Benefits: Dental and vision are available through the same allowance structure. Surplus allowance can be used for FSA-eligible items.\n\n- Administrative Considerations: The self-service platform allows the employer to use the calculator tool freely before finalizing. The enrollment process is simple for the 3-person team, with compliance support included in the flat fee.\n\n2. Stakeholders Identified\n\n- Eric Gilbert: Owner/Employer, responsible for final decisions on ICHRA adoption and determining employer contribution/allowance amounts.\n\n- Danielle Hunter: Benefits Broker/Consultant, primary relationship manager, presenting ICHRA solution options, and coordinating between Thatch and the employer.\n\n- Joseph Firenzi: Sales Representative/Implementation Specialist, responsible for product demonstration, technical guidance, and compliance support.\n\n- Aniyah and Isaac: Employees, both young and single, needing coverage for 2026.\n\n3. Important Milestones & Timestamps\n\n- 4:00 PM CT: Meeting start with initial connection challenges.\n- ~4:05 PM CT: Eric Gilbert attempted to join but was initially unavailable.\n- ~4:15 PM CT: Census clarification confirmed Eric's children will not be added to the ICHRA plan.\n- ~4:20 PM CT: Eric Gilbert joined the meeting.\n- ~4:25 PM CT: Allowance calculator deep dive.\n- 4:30 PM CT: Meeting time constraint led to scheduling a follow-up.\n- ~4:31 PM CT: Follow-up scheduled for 5:00"

            "transcript": "Joseph Firenzi:\nHi, Danielle. Not sure if you can hear me, but it looks like on your end, it might still be connecting. I can hear you. \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nSo our security doesn't really like Zoom, so I had to do something. Okay. The camera's not showing. Let me see if I can get. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nIt looks like you might have a cover over the camera. Oh, there we go. \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nAll right. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nLook, I'm like that. \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nLook. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nGreat to meet you. You sound like my daughter. \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nYou made me feel really old. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nI'm sorry. That was not my intention. \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nNo, I'm giving you a hard time. And I've had a doozy. So thank you. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nOpen enrollment season is a wild time. That's for sure. \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nIt is. It is. So thank you for providing some intel and solutions for one of my smaller clients. I'm just looking, of course, their challenge, like everybody else, trying to stay above that curve. With the renewals that are going on and all the price hikes. So, of course, that has been a lifesaver for me. So I'm really looking to see what we can do to help. Cool. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nWell, yeah, I guess I was curious before we jump in here, if this was your first call with Thatcher, have you done some with thatchers? I have. \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nI'm working with them on another client, too. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nOkay, cool. Larger one. \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nSo they're larger. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah. Is this your first one with 10 people or less? \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nYes. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nOkay. Yeah. So the flow is a little bit different with these ones, especially with virgin groups. There is, of course, a ton of flexibility with... You know, the allowance amount that you contribute to people and flexibility with the plans they choose. And for me personally, I think it, you know, can make sense. Moving forward. If we do add the employer on the first call for version groups, Because then I can walk them through how to navigate that flexibility with our calculator here. But I'll be happy to... You'll be able to do that. \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nLet me see. I might be able to... \nJoseph Firenzi:\nI will share my screen here. \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nI'll go one second. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nLet me, I might be able to get him on the phone. \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nOh, yeah, that'd be great. Hey there, nothing much. Sounds like you're in route. You're traveling. Are you? Okay. All right. Well, I'll just let them know. I'm actually on the phone. Phone with the iCarus solution, and if you were sitting at your desk, I was going to have you jump on a call real quickly with the platform. But I'll go through it and we'll schedule some time. Oh, okay, okay, okay, all right. I'll send you a link really quickly, then, all right, talk to you in a bit. Thanks bye, he says. He's turning into the office right now. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nOh, cool. Well, it's probably going to be a few more minutes, but yeah, I wanted to confirm that these details look accurate. The only person with dependence is going to be Eric. Okay, cool. So, yeah, this flow is a little bit different. Basically, with groups of 10 or less, I do a presentation of a few slides to outline how it grows. Function on thatch. Then I show them this tool, which is how you create your account through a self-service flow here. And And... Basically, I try to educate them on how to use this dynamic calculator. Where you can create a different allowance, as long as that different allowance is structured off of age, Zip code, and number of dependents. Because those three details are how the insurance carriers price the plans. I'll move forward, though, and then this is what... \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nThey can customize it if you just click what they would want to. Correct. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nThese are the default settings on the calculator. You can make a lot of adjustments, but you can see how drastic the increase in allowance is. For Eric because he's older and has three dependents, whereas the other people have no dependents and they're much younger. And then you can make a ton of adjustments. So, in theory, you could say, nope, Eric is going to cover the entire increase in cost that comes with adding dependents. So I'll click that and then we'll see the allowance go down. Because now we're not unlocking extra funds for him, for the dependents that he's adding to his plan. This would be at 50% here. Up top, we can adjust the allowances based on the employee level. Lowest cost, we'll try to save the business money. And then there's other things you can do here as well, increase the allowances or really dial it in with this slider here. So, yeah, I think it would be great to show them that. And then the most valuable thing is we can click see plans next to each employee. And then you can get a look at the buying power that this is giving them. So let's see, is he in here? Nope. Okay. Oops. We'll keep it here and I'll scroll down. So there's two great examples right off the bat here. This first one has a red number of 238. That means the entire cost of this plan is not being covered in full by the allowance. And then Eric. Have to do a $238 pre-tax payroll deduction to cover the cost difference. This one is the opposite. So this plan is covered in full, And then he would actually have a surplus of $1,125 that he could then spend on FSA eligible items, such as therapy, prescriptions, stuff like that. So a pretty useful tool here to dial in those allowances. \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nSo if he wanted to look at just covering him and his wife and not... The two children, how can he make those adjustments? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah, we do. Are you saying he's not going to add the children on the plan? \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nHe's thinking that he's not. They already have coverage elsewhere. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nSo yeah, then when he actually creates his employee account, so this is just the calculator for the admin to create the allowance structure. On the employee side of things, when he's like setting up his employee account to enroll in a plan, If he does not add his two children to his plan, the plan will only be priced based off him and his spouse. And then you also won't unlock the extra funds from the employee side. If you wanted to do that, you could also just provide allowances for the first dependent, which in most cases will be the spouse. But if there is a single parent, the child would receive this first dependent amount, and then you can just turn off. Additional dependent allowance here. Yeah, do you think he'll be a fan of this? Do you have any, I guess, notes on what he's looking for here that I can see? \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nYeah, he was looking for a little bit more affordability. Because what we were able to get in the marketplace is kind of the same as what we're seeing. I don't know if you saw the information that I sent over to you. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah, well, if I remove his children from the plan, that will reduce the cost quite a bit. Where are his children getting benefits? \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nThey are getting subsidized. They're adopted kids. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nOkay. So, yeah, I can fix the census here so that it's only reflecting for him and his wife, or his partner, and then that will lower it. So I'll do that. I think on the information that I was sent, it looked like with that current quote they had, it was like a $2,500 deductible. Is that correct? \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nWhat they were comparing against? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nOkay. So, yeah, that lowered it a bit here. We'll click see plans for Eric and we will look for a $2,500 deductible. I'll just sort by silver and gold. This one's pretty close at $2,800. That's what the price tag would be for that one. We'll look for... A lower one, though, there's another 2800 29. Some of these are higher. \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nLet me, um, can can I see what the other two young kids are doing as well? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nOh yeah, for the prices here, Yeah. So the allowance is going to mirror how the insurance carriers price the plans based off age, that code, a number of dependents. So this should be essentially equal buying power. So their plans are going to cost significantly less. We can look at ANeA here. Let's go by gold. So yeah, there's, you know, this is covered in full. And then ANEA would actually have a surplus of $110 each month with the current allowance. So this one only costs $547, $398. So much, much less expensive. Was there, maybe, like, a specific plan you wanted to zoom in on? Or do you know? \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nNo, with them, I wasn't really stressed about a richer plan because they're basically young and they. Don't mind having a more catastrophic-esque plan, you know? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nRight. \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nSo I think for the most part, he'd be interested in seeing what he could offer them for the allowance amount. And then being able to say, the way I position this whole thing is that. The way the Fetch platform works is that they would have the extra dollars remaining the month. And they could use that for other things out of pocket cost, and I think you guys have another pieces platform where they could use it for. Um, as if it's an FSA type of, yeah. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nSo the most common items are going to be like prescriptions and therapy stuff like that, dental costs. We have an entire thing called the Thatch Marketplace, where we're partnered with brands like Peloton or A Ring, brands like that, those have all been pre-approved by the IRS to be qualified medical expenses. And then we actually have a, I have a resource here I can share with you in the Zoom chat, where it is a pretty useful tool to search. What items. Are FSA or HSA eligible. I still don't see him in the Zoom, by the way. I'm not sure if he's going to be able to make it on this session, but. Essentially, I could just send him a link for this self-service signup experience. And nothing is finalized with Thatch until you actually send the invite email out to employees, which means he'd be able to use the same tool I'm showing you right now, freely, without finalizing anything. \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nHe is an insurance guy, so he does understand such as I. Okay. We could look at that link. And I've been through this probably three times with my other client. Because they're still trying to decide what they're going to do. They're on a self-funded platform and they want to use that. So they've kind of peeled every every layer apart on the platform to try to figure out if they'd be able to do this. It would be something that their employees would be able to. And of course, with them, since they're larger, they would have the concierge just to be able to walk a lot of their employees through. But I'm sure, because of the small group, will be more of a self-serve. Right. Okay. And for them to make a decision next week, is like the drop-in 411? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah, we actually just extended our enrollment deadline. Ideally, we would like them enrolled before, like the 22nd by, I believe, you know, as long as they get enrolled in a plan before the 25th, they will be set for a January 1 start date. But yeah, with only three people, shouldn't take too long to get set up at all. \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nAnd definitely doable. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nDo you think it would be beneficial to add him to another call so I can go over this with him? Yeah, if you'd like. \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nI mean, we give him a move. Are we set? Oh, I haven't set this text in a year. Okay, so Isaac is currently paying. Oh, let me ask you another question. Are there any dental or vision options within that? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYes, there are. So we offer both dental and vision, and it's just going to be rolled into the same allowance. So, after you purchase the health care plan, whatever you have remaining will be applied to dental and vision. If you don't have enough with that allowance to cover the entire cost of those three items. You'll start using the pre-tax payroll deduction method to cover the cost difference. Okay. \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nSo Isaac is currently paying out of pocket. On the exchange 273.27. So if Eric supplements, he's thinking... \nJoseph Firenzi:\nIs that the cost of his plan, or is that the amount? \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nYeah, he's using the exchange currently, and his monthly plan cost is 273.27. It's a united healthcare Plan, choice plus Network. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nThat's very inexpensive. \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nYes, very. $3,000 deductible. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nIs he receiving some kind of subsidy? No? \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nOkay. UnitedHealthcare has... Like an ACA only, which they call with, deal with, what is this called? Sorry, I'm trying to get, I may have sent it over to you. National Foundation Life, which is an ACA that is united healthcare Company, but it's an ACA only. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah, I'm not seeing anything that price on that right now. It does look like this would be around the least expensive plan, the $3.95. Oh, here's Eric. \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nThat was quick. You ran the steps, didn't you? \nEric:\nLike, I had to go to the bathroom. \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nOh, my goodness. Please don't pass out. That's three floors up. Welcome, welcome, welcome to the call. Of course, this is Joseph Frenzy and he's with Thatch. This is a solution that I wanted to share with you. That is the ICHRA solution that could possibly give you guys some savings for. I'm not sure for you and the family. But this is what we're showing is for you and your wife. And of course, with Aniyah and Isaac, I'm going to stop talking and let Joseph kind of walk through the platform. If you let him know how much you're planning on, if it's a 50-50 split, This platform will actually show you what the common allowances are. So I'm going to be quiet, Joseph, and let you do your job. \nEric:\nOkay, Joseph, before you get going, Danielle, look at your text messages. \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nAnd that's, did you share with him about the United Healthcare Plan that I get? And that price point, we were trying to figure out when we get close to that two 73 27, it's paying out of pocket right now. And we, I don't think we were able if we were able to get that close. \nEric:\nSo, okay. Go ahead, man. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nWell, yeah, thank you for the nice intro, Danielle. I want to mention that I do have another meeting in seven minutes here, and Okay, we'll make it as fast as possible. Yeah, my calendar is free for the rest of the day after that 30-minute time block. So if you're free after that at 4 o'clock central Time, happy to hop on again together. Or I have a lot of availability tomorrow as well. I was just telling Danielle before you hopped on here that we actually did just extend our enrollment deadline to the 25th. So that means, as long as you get your team members enrolled in a plan before the 25th, they will have a January start date. And then, before I proceed here, I did have a question for you. So it looks like you do have a spouse and then two children, but then Danielle said that you would probably only add the spouse to the thatch plan. Is that correct? \nEric:\nCorrect. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nOkay. Okay. Thank you. Yeah, that's helpful. So, with individual plans on the ICHRAs, the insurance carriers price the plans based off of three details, which are going to be age, ZIP code and number of dependents, which means, on a per person basis, the price for those plans are going to vary quite a bit. What you're looking at? Here are two examples of the allowance strategies you can do for your team. The first of, which on the left hand side, is a flat allowance for everyone. And then, on the right hand side, is Thatch's dynamic calculator. But in most instances, using the dynamic calculator makes the most sense. Because then you can help people out that have a higher cost to their plan. Due to their age, ZIP code, and number of dependents. So I'll go back to that calculator now. And then, with these default settings, this is what would be distributed to the team. And you can adjust this as much as you would like. And then we can also click See plans next to each employee to get a look at the buying power that the current allowance is giving them. So right now, you'd be getting $2,664. This is kind of close to the deductible I saw in the files that were shared with me. It looks like the one in that. File was about $2,500, so this is $300 more for that deductible. And then here is the cost of the plan in the font at top and then below that in the red. Is going to be the amount that you would have to pay with a pre-tax payroll deduction each month. Because it's saying that this plan is not covered in full by the allowance, and then you would have to cover the cost difference. The one down below here in the green font is an example of the plan being covered in full. And then you would actually have a surplus of $770 that would be eligible to be spent on FSA items. So this is a very useful tool to look at all the different plan options. There's 47 in your area. And then you can adjust the allowance inputs accordingly until you get something that you're happy with for the cost sharing. But I know I'm being a little long-winded here, so I was curious if you have any questions on this. \nEric:\nYou were saying how much I have to pay. So that employee pays would be the employee themselves, and then the employer is going to have a matching amount or the difference? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nSo right now, this is what the employer would be contributing with the allowance. So the allowance is coming from the business or the employer. You can edit the inputs here to increase or lower this, But it is mainly structured off of age, Zip code, and number of dependents. But there is flexibility based on these inputs. You can move these numbers around, but it is going to be based off age, ZIP code, number of dependents. And then, if it is red, that means the entire cost of a plan is not covered in full. And then you'd have to do a pre-tax payroll deduction of the red number as the employee. \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nSo from the employer perspective, where do we enter what the employer will be providing as a subsidy? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYou mean the allowance? \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nYeah, the allowance plan. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nSo yeah, that's going to be these inputs here. If you want to do the dynamic allowance, or if you did the, you know, a flat allowance, this is where you would do that. But then Eric would have to pay quite a bit out of pocket there because of the flat allowance structure, because then it's not automatically adjusting for, like, age or zip code and stuff. \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nOkay. \nEric:\nSo my question is, okay, we're going to do 50-50 for the two employees, Anayan and Isaac. Then. Then the number is looking like 300 and something, correct? Or am I off base with that? It looks like $326, $327. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nSo, yeah, you can't do it based on a percentage. With ICRAs, the reason why our engineers designed the allowance calculator that way is because of the huge amount of options with Icra plans. There's like 47 in the Zip code you lived in. So, hypothetically, if you, as the employer, were to cover 50% of any 47 plans, that would create a lot of unpredictability with cost control. So that means the allowance you see here will be the flat allowance that you pay them monthly, regardless of the plan they choose. So it's not going to be based off of a percentage of any plan they decide on, if that makes sense. \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nSo as the owner, if he says, hey, I'm going to give Anaya and Isaac $500. And they can do whatever they want to do on this tool. How would he be able to set that? So he would be able to set that as. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nSo you can hit this custom tab here. Yeah. So there's these inputs. And then, if you hit this custom tab, you also unlock this. But again, this percentage does not mean you're covering a percentage of any plan they choose. It's based off of these selections up top. So 80%. percent. Is basing the average cost of higher deductible, lower cost plans. We took the average number there, better benefits are lower deductible, higher cost, richer plans. And then so, if we go here and we try to get close to that 500 number, we can move the slider until we're, you know, something like, right about there. So that's how that would work. \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nSo just for kicks and giggles, can we click on Aniyah real quick in one minute? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah. So here's Aniyah. \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nSo that would be based on Eric giving her possibly $500 a month she would have for this silver plan, the $3,171 remaining. Correct. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nSo she'd be getting $429,000, and then that would cover this plan in full. That has a pretty close deductible to that $2,500 one, and then she would have $31 remaining. So that would cover the entire cost of this in full. \nEric:\nOkay, you scroll down a little bit more to the blues. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah. There's a $1,400 deductible that's covered in full as well. \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nYeah, and that's that limited network, like I did for the HPN that I showed you. So it looks like you guys will be able to go to those UNC docs. \nEric:\nGotcha. Okay. \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nSo the richer, then it would be more of them paying out of pocket. But if you wanted to provide something at a zero cost for them. There are some plans that are up there with some. Okay. \nEric:\nJust so I know you got to jump on another one. It is exactly 430. Can you jump back on at five o'clock? Danielle, if you're available. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah, I'm happy to. I was telling Danielle as well before you hopped on that what you're looking at here is part of the actual self-service signup experience. And then the detail I want to call out is that nothing is finalized with Thatch until you actually send the invite emails out to employees. Which means you can use the same calculator tool I'm showing you right now, freely, on your own time and then interact with these inputs. And it won't cost anything because you haven't moved forward and invited the employees. So if you'd like, I can send that right now before I hop on this call so you can interact with it, or we can just link. \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nBecause I definitely want to see, too. I know there's some additional monthly fees and some other things that he would have to pay for compliance. And I want to kind of get an idea of what it would look like. In its entirety, if you just cover the two young folks. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah, that's actually being reflected here. In the top right of this calculator, it shows the total monthly cost, which will add together all of these allowances down below. That you're distributing to the team, And then also factors in the fees to use our platform, which are going to be $45 per enrolled employee per month. That means if you have someone that declines coverage and goes on a spouse's plan at a different business, you will not be charged for them. And then there is also a $50 monthly compliance fee, but that stays flat at $50. So if you have, you know, one person on that, or three or four people on that, that's still $50 per month for that. \nDanielle Hunter of Gallagher:\nAnd we'll be able to play with any dental and vision options as well, correct? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah. So it might be regional based, depending on where you live. But we have all the major dental carriers in the country, such as like Guardian and all of those. But um Cool. Well, I'm going to hop off for now, and then I'll send that standard follow-up email, and both of you will be included on that. And then please just let me know if you'd like to chat again today, and then I'll send another invite. Okay. All right. Sounds like a plan. \nEric:\nWe'll look on your next one. \n",

Key Points Discussed\n\n- Employer's Interest in ICHRA: Mobile Technical Training is evaluating ICHRA to manage 2026 renewal costs and reduce administrative workload. The company is considering ICHRA due to its budget-based approach, which allows employees to choose individual plans, offering flexibility and control over healthcare spending. The employer is currently using Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO with Silver and Gold tier options and is leaning towards a group plan due to familiarity and network continuity.\n\n- ICHRA Benefits: Key benefits discussed include pricing based on ZIP code, age, and number of dependents, standardized rates, and plan optionality. The ICHRA model offers reduced administrative workload and no participation requirements, which is appealing to the employer.\n\n2. Identification of Stakeholders\n\n- Karina Marroquin: Assistant Director at Mobile Technical Training, primary decision-maker responsible for evaluating benefit options and making the final coverage decision.\n\n- Ty Phillippay: Thatch representative, responsible for providing ICHRA vs. Group comparison, running cost analysis reports, and facilitating the enrollment process.\n\n- Taryn Livingstone: Thatch Account Manager/Sales Representative, responsible for providing quotes, explaining the ICHRA model, and coordinating with the internal team.\n\n- Alyssa: Referral source, introduced Taryn to Karina and may have access to census information.\n\n3. Important Milestones and Timestamps\n\n- August 2025: Original renewal date; plan lapsed due to staff changes.\n- October 2025: Attempted renewal; too late to submit under the same plan, required reapplication.\n- Early November 2025: Initial contact with Ty, census requested from Paycheck, ICHRA overview provided.\n- December 9, 2025: Current conversation with Taryn, urgency for decision before Christmas for a 2026-01-01 coverage start date.\n- December 16, 2025: Call conducted to review ICHRA options and discuss group insurance reinstatement.\n\n4. Next Steps with Deadlines and Responsible Parties\n\n- Immediate Actions (By December 19, 2025):\n  - Taryn Livingstone: Send ICHRA quote to Karina and Alyssa by December 17, 2025. Provide group insurance quotes by December 18, 2025.\n  - Karina Marroquin: Review quote materials and make a final decision between ICHRA and group plan by December 19, 2025.\n\n- Follow-up Actions (Week of December 22, 2025):\n  - Taryn/Thatch Operations Team: Set up enrollment if ICHRA is chosen.\n  - Alyssa and Carrier: Manage group insurance enrollment if chosen, based on effective date.\n\n- Critical Deadline: Decision required by December 19, 2025, to ensure a 2026-01-01 coverage start date with ICHRA. Group insurance would require a delayed start.\n\nThese notes provide a comprehensive overview of the conversation, stakeholders, milestones, and next steps, ensuring clarity and alignment for all parties involved."

            "transcript": "Taryn Livingstone:\nHi Alyssa, Hi Taryn. \nAlyssa:\nHow you doing? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nHey, I'm doing well. \nAlyssa:\nHow are you up to my eyeballs and dying on the inside? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nBut we're here, but we're here. Yes, we are. We are smiling, we are hopping on calls. It's happening, even though, yeah, like, at the same time it's there's a waterfall happening in our inboxes, but it's okay. \nAlyssa:\nUm, I'm waiting for Karina to join, and I had sent her an email earlier because she was asking also about group rates. There's some confusion there. She told me she wasn't going to meet the participation for group and that their plan was terminated in August. And which is why I was just like, that's why we're looking at, you know, that's why we don't have group rates. She's just like, Oh, but we meet the participation now, so you know, why don't we get quotes? We have a horizon plan. I was just like, Well, what do you mean? You have a horizon plan? I thought it was terminated. So the plan is in fact terminated, but they... Are also interested in potentially reinstating it. So it's just like, okay, listen, like, let's talk about it on this call, because I was at 1030 this morning. And I've literally been back to back since that. And like, maybe just 10 minutes ago, had the chance to send her an email and be like, Hey, Karina, I'm so sorry, like, I haven't been able to respond. I've been literally back to back since I sent you that email earlier, you know, like, we can discuss it on this call, like, review these rates, and then do that. Because she's saying that, oh, there's people who are interested in enrolling now, but again, like, she's. Kind of all over the place. So I don't know that that necessarily means that she will actually meet participation now or not. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nGotcha Okay, well, nonetheless, um, that's that, that's okay, we can. We can chat through that too. And then also show her the Thatch quote, just so that she has, like, an idea of what to expect. \nAlyssa:\nOf course, yeah, I know I want to prioritize that and like, let's prioritize this because like, that's time sensitive. And I will, you know, review the group options and like what she has applicable there afterward. Obviously focus on this, since this is the meat and potatoes piece. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nSure, yeah, exactly, and then, and I'll, yeah, we'll do the thing. Walk her through. Like, kind of what it looks like in terms of how our quote works, how it's different, how she can control what the cost is, etc. That sort of thing. So all right, perfect. Um, how was the Um, the comic con, right? \nAlyssa:\nUh, packs you, uh. It was great, I had an amazing time. I definitely need to make sure that I... In advance, just get a hotel room for the next year, though, because even commuting in and out of the city, even by train from my friend's house, Because that's what I opted to do, rather than paying for the parking, you know, you're still then on the train's schedule, you know, and they're, They were in the middle of, I can't remember, like the the Federal department, but they were in the middle of essentially a review. So they had to shut down a whole bunch of like trains to be inspected. So, like, I was supposed to leave on Sunday at like five o'clock on a train. Well, the next one after that wasn't until seven and I missed the five o'clock train. So I was like, cool. Well, I mean, I'm still here. My friends are still here. It's still running. So I'm just going to hang out for a couple more hours. But I just need to book the hotel next year. Thanks for asking. How have you been? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, that's, that's so fun. Well, I've been craving a fun trip or experience like that, honestly. Um, yeah, no, just been just been good, just been just been grinding very pent up. Um, excited for not too much coming. I mean, obviously holidays are coming up, so that's always fun. \nAlyssa:\nUm, holidays. Yes, you guys are closed for Christmas or New Year's or both. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nwe yes, we are closed for Christmas Day. Um, but the surrounding days we are. We are in action, that's for sure, and the New Year's Day we also are closed. But I think, honestly, once 1-1 is up, I think we're gonna all have a pretty big breath of fresh air across the board. Even though obviously the grind for two ones is still very alive, it's going to be a lot more, you know, a lot more chill. \nAlyssa:\nSo the follow-up of I didn't get it in at this time, so now I must. Yeah, I know it all all too well. Um, that being said, she did say that she wants a them on effective date. And I'm pretty sure, like, maybe we got to the point where we're like, hey, we're kind of past that now. And it's going to be the same thing for the group insurance as well. So I'm also going to, you know, make sure to specify that, like, we're. The deadline was yesterday. Yeah, yesterday. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nExactly. I mean, like, so the thing is with us, so our updated date, we did, we did update the last, the last day we can do. honestly, I think it's just our operations team was just like, it's okay, we just won't sleep this month. \nAlyssa:\nUm, but I love you. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nThe last possible date for enrolling new employers with us is the 19th. So we do have until Friday if she does come back interested, but after that it's going to be kicked to two. one, but yeah. \nAlyssa:\nWell, if she is hankering and she absolutely needs coverage, then she'll just have to proceed with this for now. And then, if she does decide she wants to do group later and meets the participation, then we can switch her if need be. But, like, that's also a leveraging point for that. She'd be like, hey, well, if you need coverage for 1-1, we're your only option out of what you've been currently presented. Because facts. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nRight. Yeah, yeah, exactly. So, um, so yeah, she should be able to do that. I did get on the phone with her last week and we did have, like, a pretty good chat. So. Hopefully, she comes. Oh, and then actually, while I have you here, other group, Oceanology, the Havas group. \nAlyssa:\nNew Jersey Audiology. New Jersey Audiology. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nThere we go. Yeah. Those guys, I honestly, I think what I feel like the essence of it is, is that they're probably going to want to stay with their subsidies, is what I'm guessing. Yeah. Going with that just because, like usually when this does happen, it's like it makes more economical sense anyway, if they were to, just like, go with a marketplace plan. But that's probably what I'm guessing is going to happen with that one. \nAlyssa:\nYeah. I know that you said that that one, you were probably going to close, and that's understandable too, But also like, just say that. Then we were, we were well aware that that was a factor. Do you have a way to ping her, to send an email and be like, Hey, are you still joining? Cause I'll send her one now. If not. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOh yeah, of course. Let me do that right now. Just grab Karina. We'll just add both of us to it. And a very quick little ping. Okay, I just saw your email come in. \nAlyssa:\nI just got it. All right, great. Let me see if I can reach her on the phone, too. Give me a minute, I'll be right back. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nGreat. Yeah, sounds good. Phone number for this invitation, let's see. Um, that's a good question. I have this whole thing. Um, I'll send over the meeting invitation to her. I'm honestly, like, not extremely familiar with how, um, send here. Here is the so it should have the phone numbers on it that she can call into. I will buy your location. Yeah, makes sense. Oh, okay. Here's Karina's PC. Hi, Karina. I'm assuming you guys can most likely hear me on your end. \nAlyssa:\nHi, Taryn. Sorry, I'm trying to get the audio sorted here. I was on the phone with her. She was trying to get it to connect to her phone to call. And she said that she didn't see an option for it on the link. But I think we're just waiting for her audio to join up now. Gotcha. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOK. All right. Sounds good. Karina? Yes. Hi. Hello, hello. \nKarina's PC:\nThere you go. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nPerfect. Okay. All right. All right. It sounds like we are all caught up. Perfect. Okay. So it's great to chat with you again. Real quick. So I unfortunately have to run at the top of the hour, But I think we could probably get through your quote review right now. And so Basically, what I'm going to do is, so I know we spoke a little bit about the Icra model. My goal really is just to show you what the quote looks like and explain how the dynamic of it works. So because with an ICRA, it's a bit different than a group insurance quote, where instead of just kind of picking a carrier and some plan options and what your contribution is, you actually are picking the budget that people can use to then spend, however they would like, on whichever plan options they want. So. With this in mind, let me pick it up real quick and bring it on over. \nKarina's PC:\nI was emailing someone this morning. Let me see what's her name. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nThe other lady. \nAlyssa:\nKarina, that would be me about the Blue Cross, blue Shield. Yes, we will discuss that as well. But because Taryn has to leave at the top of the hour, we want to make sure that we review the Icra options as well. \nKarina's PC:\nAll right. Okay. Perfect. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOkay. So can you see my screen? No. I can't see my screen. I can see it now. Okay. Perfect. So what I wanted to cover with you really is just to show you what this looks like. I'm going to send this over to you and Alyssa so that you both have it as something you can review. Think of it as another option within your toolbox, if you will, for doing insurance this year. So just to give you the quick rundown of what we're looking at here. So what we start with with one of our quotes is a benchmark. You can think of benchmark as first picking a percentile. So if you pick first percentile, that's lowest cost, hundredth percentile, highest cost. You can see how that's going to change the total healthcare spend pretty drastically over there. So I'll set it to 50 for now. So what this means in terms of 50 percentile silver plans is you would be covering 40% contribution for the average cost of a silver plan. It's a little bit of kind of a way to wrap your head around it. Another way of thinking about it is, depending on what your contribution is, that's the dollar amount that each person gets to cover, in this case, 40% of whatever plan option that you want to give them as a benchmark. Does that make sense? Yeah. Okay, nice. So to show you more about this quote, then I'll go down to dependent coverage. So if I were to change anything here, you'll notice that the only numbers that are going to change are for Jean and Karina, which is you, I believe, because you have dependents, right? So that's where that will come into play if you move this around. And then also, just to also give you another heads up here, over here. It says five employees have unaffordable coverage. You can actually ignore this to an extent. So this only is going to come into play if you were to be an employer of above 50 people. In that case, it would be uncompliant because you're a small business. It's not uncompliant. You can actually offer whatever you would want, whatever you like, in dollar amounts to people. And additionally, the only other thing to flag, though, is if you do give everybody what's deemed as an unaffordable allowance amount. They would be able to go to their state marketplace. So in this case, over in New Jersey and access a government subsidy if you have one. So just something to keep in mind there. So depending on, again, this is all coming down to cost, whatever one is going to be most suitable for you, just something that you can think about there. But I also had it set to, I believe, 75th percentile with 40% contribution, because that's what your previous plan had. You can change this around. So if you wanted to go up to 50-50, you could do that. You'll notice when I do this, the total health care spend isn't changing, but your employer cost is. That's because total health care spend is representing what the spend would be for both employers and employees, whereas the total employer cost is just what you would be spending there. All right. Any questions on anything so far? No. All right, great. So now if I go down here, I will actually show you. So if I click on each individual employee and I click on this little View plans button here, you can also click on this this carrot as well. She'll click on that just a little bit easier. So this is going to show you that for each employee, which plan options they have, and also what their contribution would be for each plan option. So in this case, we're at about a 50 percent contribution with this plan, which is a classic silver plan. That's because we are, remember, going off of the 75th percentile of silver plans and covering 40 percent. So that's why that number kind of falls in that range there. And so. What you'd be able to do really is just see through the eyes of your employees what plan options they would have. And so, for instance, you could look at specific carriers if you wanted to. You could look at some United plans, Oscar plans, whatever you'd like to do there. Plan Types also looks like we'd have EPos available for you in your area. And then we can also look at gold, silver, plans, bronze, that as well. All right. And then lastly, so platform fees, this is going to be $75 per employee per month. That's why that comes out to that number there, because we have five employees down here. And yeah, going to look at annual, you could switch to this tab. This will show you your annual spend versus monthly where it's right here. And I think that that's just about everything I wanted to cover. Yeah. Any questions on how this quote works? \nKarina's PC:\nNo, no self-explanatory. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOkay, nice. Yeah, and then, and again, basically, just to reiterate, the allowances down here, these are all calculated based on what you want to set your contribution to. And also, because this is a smart allowance, what it's looking at is where someone lives, how many dependents they have, and then how old they are. To recommend, or basically to structure a dollar amount. That's going to give everybody the same purchasing power over the level of coverage that you want to offer here. So. I know I am also kind of being a dead horse, saying these things a couple of different times, but I know it's kind of a wacky looking quote to wrap your head around. So, all right. So with that, the other thing I just wanted to touch on is timeline on our end. So with us, I know that we originally discussed a one one. So January 1st coverage start date. We can still make that work on our end. The only thing that you might need to keep in mind here, though, is the last day to get your employer account set up with us is the 19th of. This week, actually. So this month, But it would be falling on a Friday. So we would just need to get moving quickly, which basically the main thing that if you did want to move forward with us, you would need to decide on is just simply what you want to do for that budget amount. And also, again, just to show you, if you want that number to go up or down, if you want to go down, if you go to first percentile bronze plans, that's going to be like the cheapest amount you could potentially offer. If you wanted to go all the way to the top, it would be 100 percentile gold plans. That's going to be the more expensive one to offer there. I'll set it back to 75th of silver. Okay. Yeah. Any questions there on timeline? No. This is if we decide to go with the IchRA model, right? The ICHRA model. Yes. You got it. I'm going to go back to the group plans. I know I was speaking to the other lady about the group plans. \nKarina's PC:\nYes. \nAlyssa:\nAnd we can go over those right now. So just to speak about the group plans and make sure we're on the same page. So you had coverage with Horizon. It was terminated in August due to not meeting the minimum participation requirements. You're stating that now you have employees who do want to participate. And you're looking to put essentially the same plans that you previously had in place. For, desirably, a one-on-one effective date. Is that all correct? Correct. Okay, so, to meet the minimum participation, 75% of your full-time eligible employees need to enroll or have the valid waivers. So I just want to make sure that, you know, if you were interested in looking at group rates, we said a couple of things, you know, straight to make sure that, you know, we're not wasting time. If you're not going to meet the minimum participation, the carrier is not going to write the policy. Also, for the group insurance, we're past the point of putting coverage in place for a 1-1 effective date. We'd only be able to do 150. At this point in time, or a 2-1 effective date. The deadline for 1-1 effective date for group insurance was yesterday. Okay. Okay. So, yeah, we do meet the 75%. Okay. I just wanted to make sure, because I know. Previously you had said there was only, you know, two people on it out of everyone, and the participation wasn't going to be met. So what I'll do then is for those. So now just a question. So you said it could be a valid waiver assuming they have coverage through a spouse, or? A different source, right? So it depends on what the source is. So, through a spouse, the VA, if they're a veteran or active duty military, through other employment or parents, Depending on age, those are always going to be forms of valid waiver, regardless of the state. I have to confirm for New Jersey, forgive me, because I work in 21 states, If they allow Medicaid as a valid waiver, Medicare is a valid waiver, but Medicaid depends on the state. So like, if they just didn't want it, that's not a valid waiver. And Medicaid may or may not be for New Jersey. I just have to confirm that. Okay. \nKarina's PC:\nAll right. Yeah, that's not a problem. \nAlyssa:\nOkay. If that's the case, you know, then I will also follow up via email as well and pull the details that you had sent me. And we can look into getting those plans quoted. It looked like there was only two people. That you had listed to get quotes for, is that correct? \nKarina's PC:\nYes, the other ones have it through their parents, I believe. There's one through the parent, there's another one that has it through the spouse. \nAlyssa:\nOkay, and then the two people who you sent me the information for, just to confirm. Because there are some other like knockout criteria. When it's a minimum of two, which is the base participation requirement, those two people are they both owners of the business? No, no, only one is. Only one is, the other one is not. And the other person is not related to the owner then, either, are they? \nKarina's PC:\nNo, she's another employee. \nAlyssa:\nOkay. Yes, we can also get you quotes for the plan that you had in place for that and review them as well. Taryn will send out the details for what we reviewed for the acre quotes from FACH, and then I will also follow up with you in regard to getting the group insurance quotes as well. For 11521. Date, as those are the next students that we can do for group. Okay. Okay. \nKarina's PC:\nPerfect. Perfect. \nAlyssa:\nWell, thank you so much for making the time to meet with us today, Taryn. Did you need to go over anything else before we wrap up? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nNope. I think that that's all good on my end. So I'll send you over, Karina, the quote that we just went over today. So you'll have that again, as in your back pocket, it sounds like you might be pretty decided on group. That being said, though, once you get the rates back, you'll probably have a better idea of just again. What you want to do spending wise, all that good stuff. So feel free to use it as you like, and I'll be in touch and we'll follow up from there. \nKarina's PC:\nOkay, perfect. Thank you so much. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nAll right. Have a good one. Bye. \nKarina's PC:\nTake care. Bye. \n",

KEY POINTS DISCUSSED\n\nEmployer's Current Situation & Interest in ICHRA\n- Current Benefits Approach: Sun Capital Hotels has been informally running an ICHRA-like reimbursement model pre-2020, reimbursing employees $350/month quarterly for healthcare expenses\n- Employee Structure: Salaried employees only; flat $350/month benefit across all eligible employees (no hierarchy)\n- Multi-Location Challenge: Company operates multiple properties across different states (5-6 payroll instances, potentially up to 10 entities)\n- Entity Structure: Properties are LLC partnerships; parent company (Sun Capital Hotels) is an S-Corp with 2 owners\n- Below 50 FTE Consideration: Each LLC operates below 50 FTEs individually, though commonly owned\n\nICHRA Value Proposition Presented\n- Cost Control: Predictable monthly expenses; employer sets allowance amounts and controls budget\n- Flexibility: Employees choose their own individual health plans in their home state (49 states supported, excluding Hawaii)\n- Multi-State Solution: Thatch can quote and support employees across all company locations with state-specific carrier options\n- Tax Advantages: Pre-tax payroll deductions for employees (vs. current post-tax reimbursement model)\n- Compliance: Full ERISA, COBRA, ACA compliance built into platform; eliminates self-administration risks\n- Age-Based Pricing: Individual market is age-rated (younger employees = lower costs; older employees = higher costs)\n\nPricing & Platform Features\n- Fee Structure: $60 per enrolled employee per month (promotional rate from standard $75; available through Q1 2026 if decision made soon)\n- No Minimums: No minimum enrollment requirements per entity\n- Payment Flow: Premium pulled on 15th of prior month; platform fees pulled on 1st of month\n- Self-Service Platform: 81% of employees complete enrollment independently; 19% use benefits experts\n- Language Support: English and Spanish currently; additional languages coming Q1-Q2 2026\n- Employer Dashboard: Real-time visibility into enrollment status, eligibility management, email tracking\n\nCompliance & Regulatory Considerations\n- 2% S-Corp Owner Rule: Owners with 2%+ ownership in S-Corp cannot participate in ICHRA (federal rule); spouse workarounds discussed\n- 1099 Contractors: Cannot participate in ICHRA\n- Class Structure: Limited to broad categories (hourly/salary, full-time/part-time, state-by-state); cannot create highly specific position-based tiers\n- ALE Requirements: Thatch will provide ALE-specific documentation and guidance\n- Plan Documents: Platform auto-generates ICHRA adoption agreement, plan document, and summary plan description annually\n\nFuture Developments\n- Legislative Changes: ICHRA may be renamed \"Choice Plan\" federally after January 2026\n- Tax Credits: Bipartisan support for employer tax credits for ICHRA adoption (expected to pass early 2026)\n- Platform Enhancements: Q2 2026 - ability to merge multiple accounts under one master Thatch account\n- Marketplace Expansion: Building vendor marketplace (Aura Ring, Peloton, Hims & Hers, etc.) with discounted products/services\n\n2.

NEXT STEPS & ACTION ITEMS\n\nImmediate Actions (By End of December 2025)\n\nThatch (Ty Phillippay):\n- [ ] DEADLINE: December 20, 2025 - Send ALE-specific compliance materials and documentation requirements\n- [ ] Provide detailed information on 2% S-Corp owner participation rules and workarounds\n- [ ] Share plan document examples (ICHRA adoption agreement, plan document, SPD)\n\nSun Capital Hotels (Deepesh/Leadership Team):\n- [ ] DEADLINE: January 15, 2026 - Internal decision meeting to evaluate ICHRA formalization\n- [ ] Review ALE compliance materials when received\n- [ ] Determine total annual benefits budget and per-employee allowance structure\n- [ ] Identify which entities/locations would participate initially\n\nQ1 2026 Decision Point\n\nIf Moving Forward:\n- [ ] DEADLINE: March 31, 2026 - Finalize decision to lock in $60/employee promotional pricing (vs. $75 standard)\n- [ ] Complete entity mapping: Confirm all payroll instances and ownership structures\n- [ ] Determine class structure: Salary-only vs. expanded eligibility\n- [ ] Set allowance amounts: Maintain $350 flat rate or adjust based on budget/age considerations\n- [ ] Address S-Corp owner participation strategy\n\nImplementation Planning (If Approved for 2026):\n- [ ] Set up 6-10 separate Thatch accounts (one per payroll instance)\n- [ ] Integrate with existing payroll systems\n- [ ] Establish bank account access for premium and fee withdrawals\n- [ ] Create employee communication plan\n- [ ] Schedule benefits enrollment period\n\nOngoing Monitoring\n- [ ] Track legislative developments on \"Choice Plan\" renaming and tax credit passage (expected Q1-Q2 2026)\n- [ ] Monitor Thatch platform enhancements, especially multi-account merger capability (Q2 2026)\n- [ ] Evaluate marketplace offerings as they expand\n\nDECISION FACTORS SUMMARY\n\nReasons to Formalize ICHRA:\n1. Compliance Protection: Eliminates risk of employee/former employee litigation over benefit administration\n2. Tax Efficiency: Pre-tax payroll deductions save employees money vs. post-tax reimbursement\n3. Administrative Simplification: Automated platform vs. manual quarterly reimbursement processing\n4. Documentation: Auto-generated plan documents ensure ACA/ERISA compliance\n5. Future Tax Credits: Potential employer tax credits coming in 2026\n\nConsiderations/Concerns:\n1. Cost: $60/employee/month fee (potentially $600-1,200/month depending on enrollment)\n2. Multi-Entity Complexity: Requires 6-10 separate account setups initially (improving Q2 2026)\n3. S-Corp Owner Exclusion: 2 owners cannot participate directly in ICHRA\n4. Change Management: Transitioning from informal to formal process requires employee education\n\nCurrent State vs. Proposed State:\n- Current: $350/month post-tax reimbursement, quarterly processing, informal administration\n- Proposed: $350/month pre-tax benefit, automated platform, full compliance, employee choice of carriers/plans\n\nACCOUNT STATUS\nStage: Discovery/Evaluation  \nTemperature: Warm - Engaged stakeholders, educational call completed, decision pending  \nProbability: Medium - Team needs internal discussion; no objections raised but cost-benefit analysis required  \nTimeline: Decision expected by January 15, 2026; potential implementation Q1-Q2 2026  \nNext Touch: Follow-up after holidays with ALE materials; check-in mid-January 2026\n\nNOTES FOR FOLLOW-UP\n- Emphasize $60 promotional pricing expires after Q1 2026\n- Highlight upcoming tax credit legislation as additional cost offset\n- Offer to model specific scenarios: $350 flat rate vs. age-adjusted allowances\n- Prepare multi-entity implementation timeline and support plan\n- Consider case study from similar multi-location hospitality/franchise client"

            "transcript": "Ty Phillippay:\nHello there. \nHaleah Todd:\nHello. \nTy Phillippay:\nHappy holidays. How are you? Doing great. We've been getting ready for the next week and all good around here. It's the end of open enrollment, though, for individuals, so it's our busy season. \nHaleah Todd:\nOh, nice. \nTy Phillippay:\nYeah. How are things going for you guys? \nHaleah Todd:\nEverything's going pretty good. Can you give me just a second? I just need to make sure everybody's got the invite and they're joining. I forwarded it out. \nTy Phillippay:\nIs that fine? Yeah, for sure, okay. \nHaleah Todd:\nAnd then William Kern, who joined us the last time, he's also invited, but he doesn't have to join. \nTy Phillippay:\nOkay, I think we got dipesh here. \nHaleah Todd:\nYeah, and we can get started if you're ready. Will can jump on at any time. For John and Dipesh, I kind of gave them a brief rundown of what Thatch does and what Ichra does. If you can kind of just go through the presentation, what you talked about with me earlier on, and kind of how Thatch works. And all the different offerings that the ICHRA accounts. \nTy Phillippay:\nAbsolutely. Let me, I'm going to, I'm trying to get into something real quick and I'll share my screen. See, looks like we got another person joining as well. OK, and we're admitting Will. There's Will. Hi, Will. \nWill:\nHey there. \nTy Phillippay:\nAll right. And then I'm sharing my screen. So, yeah, thank you for the opportunity to meet with you again. To make sure we're on the same page. I'm with a company called Thatch and our specialty is ICRA. So we'll go through what that means and really what Icra has the opportunity to become over the next couple years. But talking specifically just about Thatch, we are building a platform from the ground up, have gone through a couple rounds of funding and likely to have another one in the spring. Most of our team, if you think about, let me resize this. It's got funky size. One second, please. Okay, we'll try that. Most of the team here at Thatch, right, we had 113 employees. This is a little old. We'll crest over 200 employees by January and continue to grow. And most of it is building our platform. So a lot of... Technologists and folks who are data science experts, and they come from different financial companies as well as because we're in the benefit space insurance. So, for instance, my background, I was a vice president at United Healthcare for 10 years in Northern California. And so I've got a lot of health insurance background and I see the value of that. Because the ICRa is a way that we can slow down the cost. Upward cost spiral that the market's been stuck in for 10 years, that's only increasing. So the goal here is to take what's worked from small group insurance, which is to have a centralized resource for the employees, Have a predictable amount that you pay month to month, and then have some help with, whether it's a platform or... You know a broker or someone who's involved that when you have questions, you can get your questions answered and keep the process moving forward. What we didn't want to bring from the group and group side is the spiral of cost that just keeps going up and up. And also the constrictive piece of telling all the employees, we have a group insurance plan, but you have to go to this carrier and you have to go to this plan. And we certainly don't want to add more layers to health care. We're really trying to help employers to take a step back from being on the front lines and get back to where. The amount of money you're making available to your employees for benefits is your decision each year over year. And the way it works. Is ICRA, and go ahead and cut me off if I'm being too detailed or anything, but I think it's important that we start with what is ICRA. Icra stands for individual coverage, and then the other part of Icra is health reimbursement arrangements. So it was decided in 2020 that you could use a traditional health reimbursement arrangement as an account that you could set aside funds and make them available to your employees for them to be used for. Qualified medical expenses, and you could use that to purchase individual coverage. And so that's where Individual Coverage and HRA merged together to become ICRA. So really, all you're saying is it's a different model for helping people to afford health insurance benefits. Instead of small group and picking your one plan and having a steady and increasing renewal increase year over year. You're telling everyone, all right, for your job and your age, you're going to get x amount of dollars, and that goes towards your health insurance premium. But the requirement is they do have to go and buy an individual plan if they want to take advantage of the money. If they don't have an individual plan, then they would just choose not to take advantage of that benefit. But for... Just example, if we were to say win the lottery and be able to give $750 a month to all employees or certain employees, they would be able to buy health insurance through the individual market in their own state. And any amount that they had left over either could be returned to the company. Or they could keep that in an HRA and use it for health or qualified medical expenses throughout the year. So, one of the things that Thatch is an expert in is working with employers who have employees in multiple states. I believe one of your or some of your properties were in different states, if I'm remembering correctly. \nHaleah Todd:\nSo is that true? \nTy Phillippay:\nWrong button. \nHaleah Todd:\nThat is correct. \nTy Phillippay:\nOkay, yeah. So that's one of the challenges, both for group insurance and individual insurance. So the way it works on group is you tend to pick a carrier that works best in the home state of where you're located, or the majority of your employees are, or where the leadership team sits. And then sometimes, if you pick a national carrier, it'll work really well in all 50 states. But if you pick a regional or more of a local carrier, sometimes they will tell you, yes, We can cover your people in other states using our rental network that we don't control. And is more expensive and a little bit rougher experience from an employee satisfaction reporting standpoint. So we're able to quote in 49 states, Hawaii does not participate in the ICRA, but in 49 states, We can make sure that anyone that you're employing that's eligible for benefits is getting to choose from carrier and plan options that are in their home state. And we've been steadily growing our network. And I believe we looked last time and saw there were ample carrier options and plan options. So... One thing to consider, though, and this is the other key important part from an ICRa and the way it differs from group insurance. If you have a higher average age than about, I think the number is close to 40, then you're going to see more expensive rates than, say, someone with an age in their 20s. So, individual insurance is age rated. So a group that has 10, 20 year olds. Is going to pay considerably less for the insurance than an employer next door that has 10 58 year olds. And so that's a reality that we have to take into account. When we think about Icra versus small group, Icra's got a ton of merits and is way more flexible. And it protects your finances really well, because you are paying for your employees and in certain circumstances, you may have been overpaying. If you bought a group plan for a bunch of 26 year olds who don't tend to use the doctor. People often ask, is it cheaper for group or for ICRA? The answer I would give you is it depends on your group. If you have a higher average age, group might be cheaper per person per month. If you have a lower average age, Icra will be cheaper. And you take advantage of the way individual is priced with having a lower than average age for your employees. And then we have to talk to. About what that really, really does. But one of the biggest things that as an organization, if you're moving to Ichra, that you need to start thinking about, and it can be very simple, is how much money do we want to pay and who will be eligible for the plan? And that can help you with all of that, can help you to determine your allowance structure. And there are some ways that you can create classes. Of employees. I think that might be important for you guys. And they are generally not as specific as you want the classes to be, meaning they're more like. You can have different classes. For full-time or part-time, or hourly or salary. But often we see employers wanting to have much more specific class structure that they set up. And I advise against that, because really, Icra, in its in its truest form, isn't made to create a boutique benefits offering. That then you or someone else has to manage. It's more of setting up a fair way for employees that if they meet your plan rules, they're eligible for benefits. And they receive x amount from the company to help them to buy the individual coverage if they choose to move forward with it. So I'll talk another two, three minutes tops and then we can open it up for questions on the floor. But we are partnered with ADP Paychecks, a lot of carriers nationally. Icra is still very new in terms of insurance. World Insurance does is a slow changing industry as we've all seen. And so for us to have stood up a space age technology platform that can really make Icra administration easy for employers and their employees. We're starting to have carriers on a national basis come to us and say, we'd like to integrate the Thatch platform and use it as our Icra solution. For our current customers and for future customers that we're trying to reach. So Icra is going to be a much bigger name. You might hear some bills that are going to be passed right after the first of the year. Sounds like they'll be changing it from Icra Federally to the Choice Plan. That'll be the name of what we're discussing. And so two years from now, you'd say, oh, we should work for us. We've got great benefits. Yeah, we use the choice plan and people would know what you were talking about. And the other piece, which is very timely, is some tax credits. For employers who are going to be adding Icra as a way to provide benefits for their employees. I don't have any more detailed information on that, but it was very close to being passed before the government reset. Or closure? And there's bipartisan support. So we're very excited. 2026 is going to be a great year for ICRA. So the last piece I just wanted to touch on is that we are fully compliant with all of the alphabet soup. That you have to be compliant with when you offer benefits to your employees. That's ERISA, COBRA, ACA, and the list goes on. The way we built the simplified administration in the platform is to make sure that you can't administer something that's going to get you sideways or into even a gray area at some future date. So that's a big plus, and it's standardly included in thatch when you choose to go with us. I want to stop there. There's more areas that if this is helpful, I can keep going into, but I'd love to start to get your feedback, thoughts, and questions. \nHaleah Todd:\nI've gone through this presentation. John, Dipesh, do you have any questions? \nDeepesh Kholwadwala:\nYeah, I'll just, I'll make it very simple. That was a good, you know, front overview of the program. For me, I'm just validating what I read about Icra, and so it makes sense. And I think the centerpiece of it is that our employees can choose whatever health care they want to do under the sun. And then this is just a very formalized reimbursement process that meets the Affordable Care Act provisions. \nTy Phillippay:\nYes, the only, the only kind of nuance I would add is that Thatch has been around since 2021. And we are actively becoming or contracting with carriers in all 49 states that offer Icra. And building our own portal where your employees would be directed to go through Thatch to purchase their plan. Yeah. So that's one. \nDeepesh Kholwadwala:\nSo let me it is. And thank you for clearing that out. But okay, so, um, our team will kind of understand what we know for, uh, in pre-2020 and then probably after Covid. Our process, um, was to, kind of. We were running e-ground without knowing it was e-ground, basically, we. We saw ourself as an employer. That's below 50 FTes per LLC, but I know, could put an asterisk next to that and say, well, commonly owned, so it's not, but I'll leave that argument aside. So, yeah, we treated it like, uh, below 50. And what we did is we ran a reimbursement model where somebody wanted to go get a benefit. Healthcare, submit their invoice quarterly basis, and we would reimburse them, you know, 350 dollars per month. Um, and so we were running ICRA. So I guess the question to you then is, why should we go ahead and formalize it and not just run what we have normally done in the past? \nTy Phillippay:\nYeah, I'd fall first on compliance. Generally, when there's self-administration, there's just steps in the process that you're unaware of and requirements that could draw from other regulations. So I would at least, you know, look for a compliance partner. Or someone who could come in and say, well, if you add this proper documentation. And then you also, you know, somebody who just keeps it on track. The bogey that we're managing against, it's not like there's an enforcement that's roving. And going to come knock and say, show me your benefits, how you're using them. The enforcement is most likely an employee or a former employee. That's raised concern around how they were treated or what they received, versus what another employee received. And that's when your plan documentation comes in and all of that. The other piece, though, that I think is even more material, is if you set up this through Thatch, The employees can actually have any amount that they pay towards their benefits each month taken out of their paycheck pre-tax. So they don't have... To submit anything, it's it's a lot easier, uh, from an employee standpoint, for those people who do choose to move forward. And then there's also the savings of using pre-tax dollars versus post-tax dollars. \nDeepesh Kholwadwala:\nUnderstood? No, that? Yeah, those are probably the good answers, and those would would have been at the top three of my list as well. Yeah, um, is the the comp? And and to counter on that compliance point, I'm not arguing with you, but we treat everybody equal. So I don't know if he has mentioned that we have basically one tier. That's it is salaried employees only. And we treat everybody at three hundred and fifty dollars across the board per month. So there's no hierarchy at all. So nobody can really step out and say, you know. Johnny got more than me. \nTy Phillippay:\nThat's because they don't. Yeah. Yep. \nDeepesh Kholwadwala:\nYep. \nTy Phillippay:\nAnd I think you're smart to do that. because, to be honest, I deal with a lot of employers that have a lot of different things that they administer. And the folks who litigate in scenarios like that look early at how health insurance was structured. They're looking for places where there is not proper support and documentation. So the other... The arithmetic, though, for you guys will be the cost, which is our fee structure, and we only charge one per enrolled employee per month fee. So we charge a fee based on how many employees are enrolled each month. And our retail fee is $75. We were actually able to offer it at $60 here in Q4. If you're interested, say, in moving forward in the next cycle, call it Q1, I think I could still get support for the $60 since we're talking about it when that promotion's available. It's kind of new for us to have a fee promotion like that, but it's definitely a positive. \nDeepesh Kholwadwala:\nJust clarifying that, I'm sorry to interrupt, but $60 per employee or $60 per enrollment, what's the difference? It's the same thing, isn't it? \nTy Phillippay:\nIt's per employee, per month, ongoing. \nDeepesh Kholwadwala:\nSo that's the difference. \nTy Phillippay:\nIs that, you know, 10 people, then, you know, it's 600 bucks. \nDeepesh Kholwadwala:\nGot it. And any other platform support fees or anything like that? Or is it just that's it and done? \nTy Phillippay:\nThat's it. \nHaleah Todd:\nAnd how does the money flow? \nTy Phillippay:\nYeah, the way I can send you. I prefer you to look into the way it's all written out, but directionally, Once we're up and running, we would pull the premium amount directly, Batchwood directly from your business account. And we had talked about this on the last call. We really need to build its own group for each payroll instance that you have, because we don't have the ability to merge paychecks. Payroll instances into one master account or something like that. So kind of. The two step we'd have to figure out is which locations would have the fat access and need it, and we'd set each one of those up. And so then for each location. Each month, on the 15th, we would pull the amount that's due for premiums, and then on the first of the month we would pull the fee amount. And that just repeats 15th of the month prior to pull the premium amount, and then our fees are pulled on the first of the month. So it's two bank draws each month. From thatch got it. \nHaleah Todd:\nAnd then. And then you go into explaining how we determine like a set dollar amount, like if we say we want to put 60, 000 or 25 000. \nTy Phillippay:\nYou kind of covered that the last time and then, yeah, the so that's. That's a really important Icra question. And I keep wanting to tell people, you know, stop thinking about it as group insurance, think about it as something simpler than that. So the ways we can help you is if you know the total amount of funds that are available that you can spend in the calendar year. Then we can work backwards from that and help you to understand what is the proper amount of money to give to each person in each state, based on their age? And that's that's pretty hard to pull off, and our platform does it automatically. Um, generally, what we see is from normative data standpoint. I mean, I could sit with you and explain what we are. You guys know, you know. Certain industries are going to invest more in benefits, like startup tech companies and things like that, we see them putting this front and center. And and overfunding it as a way to compete with Apple and Google. In the service industry, we often see where there's maybe, you know, $100 to $200 made available to the employees on a monthly basis. And so it can, really, we can go from the top number where we want to see what $20,000 a month would do, or we can think about it as a flat dollar, like you had mentioned, if it's $350 for anyone whose salary, we can model what that would look like. \nDeepesh Kholwadwala:\nWell, let me ask you the other bookend of the question. So let's say we're using the 10 people example, you know, and I say, okay, I want to put $10 toward this. But there's got to be a minimum threshold in order for us to qualify as the Affordable CaReS Act, right? \nTy Phillippay:\nWell, and that's as an ALE, you know, as a larger, yeah. And so I'm going to send you guys since. I have gotten it recently. I saw it was updated. I'm going to send you our ale material that will walk you through all of that. \nDeepesh Kholwadwala:\nAnd while you're doing that, my one last question is for me is, what year end documents do you guys file with the government? \nTy Phillippay:\nWe populate them into the platform. So we create documents for you. And let me see. I'm going to stop sharing real quick. And let me see if I can see standardly the name. I mean, they're essentially your plan documents that outline what you've set up in Thatch. So if you have a waiting period or not, it's in there. Or, you know, all the different pieces that you have set up so that you could file that. As needed, with whoever you would be filing it with. The material that's in there is one second. Under the Documents tab, generally, we're going to see what's an Icra adoption agreement, it's called, and then the more formal Icra plan document and summary plan description. And that's what you might need to file along with other filings. And so we just generate it for you, and they both sit in your documents tab each year. \nHaleah Todd:\nI have a hard stop at two, but could you go through, like, really quick? What if we give them just through what the website looks like and where they can select the plans. And if we do 350. Per employee, we can choose either to take the money back if they don't choose a plan that goes up to $350,000, or they can get it on a FSA card. \nTy Phillippay:\nYeah, and that's your options. So, let's look quickly again at slides. When we come into the product, which is a, you know, platform, and it's got an invite, it's going to be very descriptive. It's going to be driven off of the link so that once somebody comes to the platform, they'll be recognized, brought right in. First thing is, they would set up a user ID and password. Once they had their profile set up, they would be able to see how much money was available to them. So in this case, I'm going to be zooming in here. The the budget would look, it would say 350 dollars, so when they came in, they know, okay, well, I've $350 available. And then they would be able to do the shopping experience where they could search by carrier or by plan, or they could search by which metallic tier plan they wanted, Or I only want HMO, or I only want PPO. When they're looking at specific plans, and this is just an example, obviously, there's going to be a little notation. Below the premium amount of how much money is remaining from their benefits. That if they were to pick this plan, they would have 150 remaining each month. And under this setup, that would be available to each and to that employee to use on qualified medical expenses. Or you could have it set up where they went in and they picked their plan, and if their plan premium is under the allowance amount you gave them. Any remaining amount amount of money is property of of the company. It just gets returned after they've made the decision. reallocated. We don't ever take that money from you. It's more of like the accounting of it is that amount would just be staying in the business account. When people come to the platform, 81% of people can come in, choose a plan and move about, move on with their day. They're completely self-service. For 20% of people that might need a little more help, we have benefits experts available. They generally set up a business meeting with an expert for the following day. And so we don't make it cumbersome or hard on people that suddenly feel like they have to learn everything there is to know about insurance to make the right decision. We also can support Spanish speakers, and I think Q1, Q2 will be expanding to some additional languages, but right now it's just English and Spanish. Let's see, I should mention, the employer site for you in real time, you'd be able to see all of your payroll. Now it's when I say that, remember, we're thinking about this, like if we were to suddenly add an Icra? And you guys had 20 different locations and payrolls, I think you had five or six, but we got to think about each one of them as being its own little batch account. Because we're driven again off of payroll. So we'll see what's loaded in payroll for that company. And then you can go in and enable which employees are eligible for benefits and send them an email directly from the enrollment. Page. And then you can track if they've opened the email, if they're working on it, if they've enrolled. And it makes it really easy for you as the employer. The last piece here is we'll certainly be adding AI only when it's necessary and obviously in improvement. We are not big fans of using AI as frontline customer service. At times in Q4, we had to do it for triaging. But we're already back off of our kind of AI. And we learned a lot of what the AI's capability is, what questions it can answer immediately. So we're going to continue to work on that piece. And then the last piece, We're building a marketplace within Thatch so that not only can your employees have access to the carriers and plans and see how much money is made available. If we think, you know, three, four years down the road, let's say you guys have... Continue to grow the business. You have more people who are salary, and maybe more people who can take advantage of. Our marketplace where we've got the lowest costs for products and services through several different vendors. That are pretty hot. And we are adding a vendor a week right now. So Aura Ring, Peloton, Hims and Hers, lots of different resources that are available, or products and services that people want. So we believe. Truly, I believe that the more people that we add to thatch and the individual pool that we're creating, that we have a chance to start to actually bend the cost curve down. It'll take years, But when people take control of their own insurance, pick their own plan design, they engage more with their health insurance. They tend to value it more. And just that alone, plus, carriers can manage individual books of business, much more. Efficiently and profitably, because individuals tend to stay with a carrier for five to seven years, whereas small groups leave now every third year. So taking a big step back, I think when it's the right time for you, that's great, But it's already the right time for a lot of employers to move to the ICRA. And we're only going to hear more and more about it over the next two to three years. I'm sorry, I'm going to have to jump off. \nDeepesh Kholwadwala:\nThis has been very educational. I think we, I got what I want out of this. I think we'll sit back and make a decision. \nTy Phillippay:\nExcellent. Okay. And as other things come up, you guys know how to get in touch with me. Have a wonderful holiday. \nDeepesh Kholwadwala:\nThank you. You too. Bye-bye. \nTy Phillippay:\nOkay, thanks. \nJon:\nHey, Kai. Yeah. I got just one quick question. I think I may have just missed it when I stepped away from my desk for a minute, but where? Each entity is gonna have its own batch. \nTy Phillippay:\nLogin Yeah. \nJon:\nHow do we meet the minimum or is there minimums? \nTy Phillippay:\nIt's funky, right? It's a huge adjustment, there's no minimum. Okay, so we could have one enrollee from each, okay, and that's a big advantage for the Icra. Um, but again, I think you guys nailed this. You do want to make sure that everybody's been offered, right? That's kind of the the thing you want to fall back on is. Look, everybody whose salary. They automatically get invited to benefits once they've met the plan, you know, any waiting period you have, or anything. And that's the most important piece. But we see this a lot with, I mean, what was it? I, oh, I was just working with a fast food company that's a gentleman has a bunch of different fast food. Franchises, and so it was interesting. Some tend to have a heavy amount of money they're paying towards the manager in that location. And they had no employees enrolling and other franchises, probably because of the way the franchise rules are written. They would have five out of eight employees enrolling, and they were giving more money in that instance to the team members than they were in other franchises that they own. So you do have the ability to treat each location separately. \nJon:\nOkay. \nTy Phillippay:\nAnd I think that matters some, too. \nJon:\nYeah, for sure. \nTy Phillippay:\nBut the one thing is, often when we get done with these calls, what happens is everybody kind of gets inside. Well, what if we gave the… People who have been here five years a little bit more, right? Because you want, you want to. I, I totally respect that where it comes from, but we're we're cautioning people. Because we do believe that there will be some mechanism, whether an enforcement or some regulation that comes within the next 12 months that's going to validate that. You can't pick and choose very much. You really have to stick with hourly salary, full-time, part-time, or you can do things state by state. So if you have one state with one property that's funky, you can have pretty robust differences state by state if you need it. \nJon:\nOkay. All right, cool. Then the, I forgot what I was going to ask. Oh, so about the splits where you're talking hourly salary, anything at all by position? \nTy Phillippay:\nOr is just, yeah, barely, um, I mean, it is much. They're made very broad and sweeping for a reason. They don't want a lot of, um kind of ability for parsing things out from position to position. I do see between me and and you guys is, you know, since I'm bringing all this new information to you. I also, though, do see a lot of them employers saying, well, that's all fine and good, but the way I need to structure my business, I'm going to do this. And we try our best to be able to accommodate those things, even if they're a little bit in the gray area of, is this a fair line of demarcation between employees? But obviously, if it was like something where I just arbitrarily want these people, not those people, we'd obviously advise strongly against anything like that. \nJon:\nOh, yeah. No, it's not that kind of situation. It's just the major pay differences between, say, our general manager, director of sales, and then the bump way down, like half of the other ones. I would say. Even is our assistant general managers for office managers, and those are kind of few and far between, but still on salary. \nTy Phillippay:\nSo yeah, yeah, and then are you guys. How are each entity? how is each entity set up from a tax perspective? Meaning are they s-corps or are they corporations, or how are they tasked? \nJon:\nLLC Partnership type. \nTy Phillippay:\nOkay, and they're not S-Corps. \nJon:\nThe only S-Corp is Sun Capital Hotels, so the three entities that we manage are LLCs. \nTy Phillippay:\nThen, how many S-Corp owners are there for Sun Capital? \nJon:\nTwo currently. \nTy Phillippay:\nOkay. Would they be enrolling on the Icra or be interested in doing that? \nJon:\nPossibly. I'm not real sure. \nTy Phillippay:\nOkay. So one thing I just, if you can bring to the team, there's lots of information out there about it. Literally any chat, GPT, Google, There are rules around anyone who has 2% ownership of an S Corp. because. They are considered to be taxed advantaged because they have that Escorp ownership and they cannot participate in an Icra, and that's a federal rule. But, but, but, but again, we're. I'm trying to advise people because I just don't want to. I don't want to not give you the full picture. We're seeing things like, uh, an owner's wife is a W-2 employee or decides to become a W-2 employee, and the owner enrolls under the wife's plan. I mean, this is not like, you know, robbing a picasso from an art museum. It's just more of taking advantage of some newer, less fleshed out rules. I think within reason, if you have an owner that can choose to just purchase their benefit plan through their state exchange. They're not going to get reimbursed for that tax any way we do it. We can't run an owner pre-tax. Sometimes it's just easier for them to go by their individual plan, and that's their plan. That they own and operate. Other times, we've seen the old model that you're talking about, a stipend is given in a separate way to an owner, But they just can't be on the ICHRA, because of that rule. \nJon:\nOkay, interesting. Okay, so that's 2% ownership, they advise not to, just flat out can't. \nTy Phillippay:\nYeah, flat out can't. Yeah, and if you have any 1099s, you can't have them on the plan either. I'm just trying to throw kind of some of the stuff that we'd normally land on. And then there will be a time in, it sounds like Q2 of next year, where we're going to be able to merge accounts all under multiple accounts, all under one Master Thatch account. So that's on the technical roadmap that will happen. But again, the biggest thing I wanted to make sure I said three times on this call. If we, if and when we move forward, we all just have to understand. If it's six or seven sites, we're building six or seven. Little ICHRAs. And that it just takes time. And it also takes somebody to be the point person and have a list of all the passwords for a little bit of time. And then I think we'll be improving our administration capabilities dramatically throughout the next year. \nJon:\nYeah, it could potentially be 10. \nTy Phillippay:\nRight. Yeah, that's what came up in the last call. And we're... We're not afraid to write one person enrolling groups. I just am trying to make sure that somebody doesn't pull their hair out on your side. Uh, because, you know, we're taking 10 charges from 10 accounts, right, right and just. But we, we do it right and we can set it up appropriately and then make improvements as we go. \nJon:\nYeah, the separate charges actually help us out significantly with with our reconciliations. So, Mike, we're. Good hosting that one thing for that one hotel, that's, yeah, yeah, to reconcile a massive. And well, I guess. We just moved individuals from each of those individual accounts to some master account, whatever, and then draw it off of that so we could still keep it clean. \nTy Phillippay:\nBut yeah, yeah, our our founder, our technical founder, was early stage at Stripe, and so he's very, very smart in the payments world. And it's a huge advantage for us and we're going to continue to make it, um, easier and more modularity. But also working on this, you know, orchestration layer. Like, how could we? How could we do this in mass if we needed to, within compliant rules and everything? That'll probably be more of a three, two to three years out, yeah, but um, obviously there's a lot of people in your industry and in like. Other franchise model industries that we need to solve for. \nJon:\nCool. \nTy Phillippay:\nYeah. \nJon:\nAll right. Lots of good info, man. Thank you. \nTy Phillippay:\nYeah, absolutely. So have a great holiday and I'm around when you guys are ready to talk more. \nJon:\nAlrighty. \nTy Phillippay:\nOkay. Thanks so much. Bye-bye. \n",

KEY POINTS DISCUSSED\n\nEmployer's Interest in ICHRA\n- Primary Driver: High healthcare costs with current Gusto benefits for two families (owners) plus one employee\n- Cost Concerns: Thatch quotes appeared significantly lower than Gusto offerings, prompting investigation into legitimacy and pricing structure\n- Current Situation: \n  - Maryland-based S-Corporation\n  - 3 total people: Mike, business partner, and business partner's 28-year-old daughter (employee)\n  - Current benefits through Gusto\n  - Renewal period active; current plans expire February 1, 2026\n  - Growth anticipated in 2026 with potential new hires\n\nICHRA Model Understanding\n- Education Provided: Explained ICRA (Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangement) as alternative to traditional group plans\n- Key Benefits Discussed:\n  - Individual market plans rated against millions vs. small pool (lower premium increases)\n  - Pre-tax employer contributions to employee health insurance budgets\n  - Employee choice across 5+ carriers with 20+ plan options in Maryland\n  - Flexibility to spend leftover funds on qualified medical expenses\n  - HRA rollover functionality (unused funds stay with employer)\n  - HSA-eligible plans available\n\nS-Corp Ownership Considerations\n- Critical Discovery: As S-Corp owners, Mike and his business partner don't qualify for ICHRA coverage\n- Solution Presented: Owners can purchase individual ACA marketplace plans and write off as business expense (pass-through entity benefit)\n- Action Required: Mike needs to consult CPA for tax implications\n\nAdministrative & Integration Concerns\n- Gusto Integration: Confirmed seamless integration for payroll deductions and employee roster import\n- Current Structure: Employee gets free coverage; family plans covered at 50%\n- ICHRA Equivalent: Can structure allowances by dependent count to mirror current approach\n\nPricing & Plan Availability\n- Rate Discrepancy: Mike noted Thatch quotes lower than direct ACA marketplace research\n- Explanation: Off-exchange plans (sourced directly from carriers) vs. on-exchange can have pricing differences\n- Maryland Market: Favorable individual market with affordable options, including $0 deductible plans\n\nFlexibility & Timing\n- Mid-Year Addition: ICHRA can be added anytime, triggering special enrollment period\n- Allowance Changes: Annual adjustments only; cannot modify mid-year except through new class creation (to be confirmed)\n- Competitive Adjustments: Better to plan allowances upfront; mid-year changes limited\n\n2. STAKEHOLDERS IDENTIFIED\n\nProspect Company (AloeDesk)\n- Mike Vandre - S-Corp Owner, Primary Decision Maker\n  - Role: Evaluating benefits options, managing renewal process\n  - Responsibilities: Review Thatch platform, discuss with business partner, consult CPA\n  \n- Business Partner (Name not provided) - S-Corp Owner, Secondary Decision Maker\n  - Role: Co-owner requiring consultation on benefits decision\n  - Responsibilities: Review proposal with Mike, provide input on direction\n  \n- Employee - 28-year-old daughter of business partner\n  - Role: Current employee requiring coverage\n  - Note: Family relationship may influence decision-making dynamics\n\nThatch Team\n- Taryn Livingstone - Business Team Representative\n  - Role: Primary contact for companies <20 employees\n  - Responsibilities: Education, quoting, implementation support, follow-up\n\nExternal Partners\n- CPA/Tax Advisor (To be engaged)\n  - Role: Confirm S-Corp tax write-off strategy for owner-purchased plans\n  - Responsibilities: Validate tax treatment of individual plan purchases\n\n3. IMPORTANT MILESTONES & TIMESTAMPS\n\nCritical Dates\n- December 16, 2025: Initial discovery call completed\n- December 19, 2025: Last day to register company for 1/1/26 coverage start (NOT APPLICABLE - current plans through 2/1/26)\n- December 28, 2025: Last day for employee enrollment for 1/1/26 start (NOT APPLICABLE)\n- February 1, 2026: Current Gusto plan expiration date - TARGET START DATE\n- 2026: Anticipated growth/hiring period\n\nKey Conversation Moments\n1. S-Corp Ownership Discovery: Identified that owners cannot participate in ICHRA; alternative solution provided (ACA + business expense write-off)\n2. Rate Validation Question: Mike questioned why Thatch quotes lower than marketplace; explained off-exchange vs. on-exchange pricing\n3. Flexibility Inquiry: Discussed mid-year addition capability and allowance adjustment limitations\n4. Integration Confirmation: Verified Gusto partnership and seamless payroll integration\n5. Dependent Coverage Structure: Explored how to replicate current 50% family coverage model using dependent-based allowances\n\n4. NEXT STEPS WITH DEADLINES\n\nImmediate Actions (By December 20, 2025)\n- Taryn Livingstone:\n  - [ ] Send conversation summary with links and resources\n  - [ ] Include thatch.com/plans link for plan exploration\n  - [ ] Provide access to sophisticated quoting tool (Start Now → Company Account)\n  - [ ] Confirm class creation rules for mid-year allowance adjustments\n\n- Mike Vandre:\n  - [ ] Explore Thatch quoting tool using actual employee data (ages, zip code 21769)\n  - [ ] Review plan options available in Maryland\n  - [ ] Test allowance structures (same dollar vs. smart allowances with dependent counts)\n\nShort-Term Actions (By December 23, 2025)\n- Mike Vandre:\n  - [ ] Discuss Thatch proposal with business partner\n  - [ ] Consult CPA regarding S-Corp owner tax write-off strategy for individual ACA plans\n  - [ ] Compare Thatch quotes against current Gusto renewal rates\n  - [ ] Determine preferred coverage start date (2/1/26 vs. later if hiring delays)\n\nFollow-Up Schedule\n- Late This Week/Early Next Week (December 19-23, 2025):\n  - Taryn to check in on business partner discussion outcome\n  - Assess interest level and address any additional questions\n  - Determine timeline for decision\n\nImplementation Timeline (If Proceeding)\n- For 2/1/26 Start:\n  - Company registration deadline: ~Mid-January 2026 (more flexible than 1/1 start)\n  - Employee enrollment deadline: ~Late January 2026\n  - Sufficient time given current renewal through 2/1/26\n\nOutstanding Items to Resolve\n1. Confirm exact allowance change rules (annual vs. class-based flexibility)\n2. Validate S-Corp tax write-off strategy with CPA\n3. Finalize business partner buy-in\n4. Determine if waiting for additional hires before implementation makes sense\n5. Clarify rate discrepancy between Thatch quotes and direct marketplace research\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES\n\nPricing Structure\n- $45/month per enrolled employee\n- $50/month flat compliance fee\n- Only charged for enrolled employees\n\nCompetitive Position\n- Maryland individual market favorable for ICHRA model\n- Significant cost savings potential vs. Gusto group plan\n- Strong Gusto integration reduces switching friction\n\nRisk Factors\n- Small team size (3 people) with 2 owners ineligible for ICHRA\n- Only 1 eligible employee currently (business partner's daughter - potential conflict)\n- Growth-dependent value proposition\n- Rate confusion may require additional validation/education\n\nOpportunity Indicators\n- Proactive research during renewal period\n- Cost-conscious decision maker\n- Growth plans for 2026\n- Open to innovative solutions\n- Strong existing Gusto relationship (integration advantage)\n\nCall Sentiment: Positive, educational, exploratory  \nLikelihood to Proceed: Moderate (pending business partner discussion and CPA consultation)  \nRecommended Follow-Up: December 19-23, 2025"

I just put my last name for some reason. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOh, it's Mike. Okay. Is it your last name, Vondre? Is that how you pronounce it? \nVandre:\nVandre, yeah. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nVandre. Cool. All right. Nice to meet you, Mike. All right. Well, I'm excited to kick things off on this call. Quick intro on me. I'm Taryn. I am on the business team here at Thatch. So, primarily focusing on companies less than 20 employees, which is why we are talking right now. But anywho, thanks for joining me this afternoon. Basically, how this is going to work is. I am really just looking to learn more about where your head's at regarding benefits and also insurance, and what sparked your interest in Thatch. With that, actually, I'd love to kick it over to you for a quick intro on yourself. Also, where you're based right now, and then we'll get on into it. \nVandre:\nYeah, so our company is based in Maryland. We're very small, so it's me, my business partner, and one other employee. The benefits costs for healthcare for basically the two of our families and this other employee are very high. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah. \nVandre:\nSo we're in the period of, we traditionally use Gusto, our benefits provider, to shop for health plans. And so I decided just to look around and see, like, is this the going rate? Is there any other options here? Is there any flexibility? I saw your site and it looked interesting. The quotes were quite a bit less than what Gusto was offering. I did see in the email. I don't know if there's you or someone else saying that. We effectively don't qualify the two business owners under the S Core Plan, which we can talk about. But I'm curious because we do have some growth potential this year, so we may be getting more employees. So I decided just to keep the appointment and see, uh, what this was and how it works. And if the quotes that it gives on the website, if those are real quotes. Because I didn't understand really why they were so much less than what we were seeing from Gusto. Gotcha Yeah, this is all extremely helpful context, Mike. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nAnd, okay, actually, to kick things off first, quick question on the quote. When you got a quote through us, did you go to stash.com, hit Start now, and start to sign up? Or did you go to our quotes page? \nVandre:\nI think I went to, there's something where I could, like, see the quote. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOh, nice. Okay. Yeah, I'm just curious. There's a couple different ways we in all the employees ages, or all the tenants ages. \nVandre:\nYeah. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOkay, nice. All right, great. \nVandre:\nGet your small business health insurance quote. Yeah. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOkay. Oh, perfect. Yeah. So you did the the public quote tool, which is which is perfect. So to quickly answer your question there, actually, and I'll give you the rundown on that, how an Icra model works. Are you familiar with icra models much? \nVandre:\nNo, I just became aware of it a couple of months ago. Perfect. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOkay, great. In that case, I'll give you kind of the rundown there, too. So basically, the reason why you're seeing that these plans are a lot less than gusto is that, so with Gusto, it's a PEO. So it effectively operates similar to a small group health plan. plan, right? With small group, rates typically will increase quite a bit the longer you're with them. That's kind of just how it works, unfortunately, with small group plans. All of the plans that we offer through Thatch are individual plans, meaning that they are on basically the same ish plans as what's on the ACA. The only difference is that the plans we offer are sourced directly from the carriers themselves. So, basically, that... This is their off-exchange version of the plans. And that's where we get our plans from when we list them on our platform. So because of that, instead of being rated, if you will, between just yourself and a very small pool of people, you are rated against millions of people. On the individual market, hence why we don't see many increases in premiums there. Yeah. \nVandre:\nBut your rate should be similar to if I went to Healthcare.gov and looked for a plan, an individual plan. Correct. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah. So actually, they will be very similar to that. So to answer your question there on S-Corp ownership, because we do work with quite a few S-Corps at that. Honestly, most of our business is S-Corps. So for the owners, what we'll usually have them do. Is go and find a plan on the ACA. And just simply what you do outside of that is write that off as a business expense. In terms of how, I mean, okay, a little bit butchering this a little bit, But basically, as a pass-through entity, you can list your insurance as a business expense versus a personal expense for the owners of the company, right? That's kind of the tax benefit you get there. So that's what you would do for your insurance. And then for everyone else's, and I'll actually put my slides now, we can kind of talk through this, But with Thatch and with an Icra in general, what it allows you to do is set a budget for people to buy their insurance. That budget is pre-tax. So you're actually contributing pre-tax dollars to go straight into buying people's health insurance for the employees at your company there. So here, let me. Go like this. Can you see the screen? Get bigger. All right, perfect. Okay, great. So I'll give you the quick rundown here. And then you already, you actually already went through and found yourself a quote, which is, which is great. So we can talk more about what that looks like, too, in a second. But to kick it off, just to give you the overview, here, at Thatch, our mission is to build a healthcare system people love. So why are we doing this? Well, right now, generally speaking, the way that health insurance works for employers, especially small group employers, is. You need to pick one carrier with one to three plan options that meet everybody's needs. But oftentimes, this creates some issues. So, first off, if you do have anyone in your pool who ends up being a little bit more expensive than the rest, It gives the insurance company a reason to hike up premiums for everyone in the group. And similarly to as you're hiring people. Usually, you'll have some folks who might have a doctor or a specific medication that they need to get covered by a specific carrier. If you end up picking one carrier that isn't going to fit their needs, that could be a reason that they might have paused before joining your company. For a lot of reasons, it's just a lose-lose situation, one-size-fits-none scenario with insurance. That is where we come in with our ICRA. So ICRA, very long acronym, but stands for Individual. Coverage health reimbursement arrangement. Basically, what that means is you, as an employer, can set aside this budget for each employee to then spend on their health care by first buying a medical premium. And then with any leftover funds, if there are leftover funds, they can spend that on anything as a qualified medical expense. So in this case, this employee bought prescriptions for $100. And she bought HIms and hers, which is a telehealth vendor. $400 as well. And any leftover funds, if there are any, would just go into the HRA portion of the ICRA, meaning health reimbursement account, which acts quite similarly to an FSA account, where it's pre-tax dollars that the employees can keep and will accumulate month over month. But at the end of the year, if they don't use it, then they would just simply, or the money then would simply just stay in your pocket as the employer. So you wouldn't lose any money. More so, you're setting the budget and that people can spend it how they like. \nVandre:\nNow, the plans that they purchase could be an HSA plan, and they could contribute to that on their own. Correct. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah. So we do have HSA eligible plans. That's something that you can actually search for when you're looking at the plans on Thatch. And basically, for those plans, each one of them has a specific document of how to contribute to the HSA. Anyone that is an HSA eligible plan, they can have alongside an HSA. So that basically will work like that. Do your folks currently have HSAs? Yeah. Gotcha. OK. Yeah. So they can look for HSA eligible plans in that case. Yeah. Cool. Any other questions on? \nVandre:\nYeah, it's a it's a cool concept. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, yeah, it's pretty neat. \nVandre:\nWhat's it called? an icra? or whatever? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nIcra, yeah, you got it. \nVandre:\nIs that a new thing that the government created that's now showing up in companies? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOr, Yeah, it's a great question. It actually, you're, yeah, you're spot on there. So in 2020, it was a bipartisan law that was put into place, and then basically strengthened over the past couple administrations. To then become a new way of doing insurance. That essentially means that more people are going to be on the individual market. So, correct. Yes, it's a, it, basically, not too long ago, was a new way of doing it. And now, since then, We, plus a couple other vendors, have come out as a way to actually implement it. because, as you can imagine, managing many, many individual plans for your employees is just a bit of a chaotic nightmare. But with a platform like this, it makes it easy. Yeah, that's a good question. All right. So to dive into this piece here. So with medical plans in any given area, and you can obviously already made a quote. So you saw what this looks like for Maryland. We have around five carriers with over 20 plan options. So we're giving employees more optionality than ever on where they actually go for their insurance. But, of course, with more options means that we also want to make sure they're supported to make the best decision possible. So that is where we come in, first and foremost as a tech platform. So what we'll take into account is who someone's doctor is, any existing medications. They're on to recommend a plan that is going to work best for them. And then, similarly, we also have a concierge team, which is our team of plan support advisors who can hop on at any point in time and actually guide employees through their plan selection process there. So if they want to talk to a real human, they can. If they want to use the AI, they are more than welcome to do that as well. Yeah. Any questions on employee support there? All right. And then jumping over here. So this is actually kind of the... More fun part of this whole concept of having these like spending dollars left over right after you buy your health insurance. So at that, we really were thinking, how do we take this idea, but also, like, expand it to become a new way of offering healthcare through your employer that people really love. And so building off of that, we created the Thatch marketplace. So this is basically a way to offer all of the vendors you see here. We've actually made partnerships with two year employees to actually unlock new, fun ways of spending on their health, wellness, and also preventative care, too. So just a fun extra perk. That is also something that you as an employer can turn on or off, depending on if you want to offer it. We work with a lot of different employers with different goals. So if your goal is more so cost containment, then this might be something you want to turn off. If you're thinking more on how can we kind of maximize benefits, include more things in our package, then it's a fun thing to turn on, too. Okay, very lastly. So this is just going into the nuts and bolts here. In general, you can think of Thatch as an end-to-end medical benefits platform. So we will handle everything from the enrollments through to the ACA compliance and reporting, all the way down to receipt verification. So that's going to be if you have somebody who goes to the doctor, They pay for a copay with their credit card, and they want to get reimbursed with the extra dollars in their account. They could just upload the receipt to us and we would then process the reimbursement there. And, very lastly, payroll deductions. So this comes into play if you have anybody who selects a plan that's more expensive than your allowance. So, to illustrate a simple example here, if instead we had this employee, Maria, choose a plan that's $1,000 instead of $500, there would be a $250 difference that she would make up. What we do is we integrate directly with her payroll. So it would come straight from her payroll to Thatch to pay for that plan on a monthly basis. And the fun part about that actually is that that employee contribution there, so both employer being $750, employee being $250, is also pre-tax. So it's also a benefit to the employee in that regard, where they're at least being able to pay for that without being taxed on them. All right. So anywho. That is pretty much everything I had to go over regarding how Thatch works, which I know I just kind of speed ran through. But yeah, any questions you have? \nVandre:\nHow does Thatch make money? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nGreat question. So we charge a $45 per month per employee fee. That's only for enrolled employees, though. And so kind of similar to like a broker would charge if you're going through them. And then we also have a $50 monthly compliance fee. That one is flat, meaning that it will not be per employee. It's just $50 a month. \nVandre:\nHow does it work with like, if we use... Gusto for all of our other stuff. How does it work with, like connecting that all up, like for the automatic payroll deductions and things like that? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, great question. So Gusto actually is one of our closest partners. Basically, it would be a very quick and easy setup. So I can actually show you kind of, like, what that looks like. You'd be prompted as you're signing up to pick your payroll provider. Gusto is one of the first ones. You'd click on that. And then, with just setting and connecting the accounts, we'd be able to both import all of your employees to Thatch, so that we'd have the roster there too. But then also, their payroll would be synced up automatically. That's cool. \nVandre:\nYeah. Let's see what else. Are there rules around? The amount, the budgets that you set for the employees? Is there rules around, like, you give everyone the same amount, or are there different, like, can you give more senior employees, more budget, or how does that work? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, that's a great question, actually. So, that's also a very good segue question to this part of what I can show you here. So, to answer your question, yes, there are rules. I'll show you the two ways to do it. The screen I'm looking at right here, though, this actually is what you would come across if you went to thatch.com, clicked Start Now, and went through the flow to sign up as an employer. Basically, you'd make a quick little account. It's kind of no strings attached, though. The point is to get you to this page. And then what you would do, similarly to the quote that you made for yourself, is you'd put in your employee information. I'm just going to click through these screens so we get to the allowance. Piece there. So it gives you a little little roster. All right. Okay, so coming to this piece here. So basically, for allowances, there are two ways to do allowances compliantly. So the first way is, like you just said, same dollar amount for everybody. Very straightforward. Everyone just gets the same amount. The only issue that this can cause, though, is if you do have some people who are younger versus a little bit older, for instance. The older people are going to get less far with those same dollars as someone who's younger, just simply because they need to pay more for insurance, right? Similarly, if you have dependents versus no dependents. So over on smart allowances, what we've done is we've actually taken into account each one of these parameters here. So where someone lives, how old they are, and how many dependents, they have to recommend a dollar amount that would work best for them. And so, to illustrate what this looks like, here. Basically, we'll start on the same dollar amount, just to make it easy. One thing we actually did add the same dollar amount, though to make it a little bit more editable, is you can add dependent amount here. So, for instance, if I give everyone 400 but an extra 300. If they have first dependent, another 200 for any additional dependent that they have. Then this is what the allowances could come out to. So you can change it around a little bit, the key is it really needs to stay pretty strict to dependent count. Age and location as far as where they live. So. \nVandre:\nYeah, because I think the way we have it set up now is the employee, the employee gets free health insurance, like completely covered, but then the family plan to cover 50% or something like that. It's defined as a rule. Gotcha. This is the way to kind of effectively do something similar. You just need to figure out how much budget per child essentially to allow. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nRight, exactly. So, correct. Kind of similar to that. And actually, a smarter, another way of thinking about it, if I go over to Smart Allowance is, I'll kind of explain it this other way. And this is actually going to be a little bit more mimicking of, like, what a group experience is like. So for this, the first thing you would do is pick your coverage level. You can think of lowest costs, like offering everybody a bronze plan, Best fit for you, silver, better benefits, gold plans. And then if I go over to here to custom, so what this is actually letting you do is get pretty granular with how you do allowances. So you'd be able to. Drag this around, depending on what you want to contribute to people's plans. And you can see that it would change down here. Also already automatically added down here is taking into account that Bob Smith is younger and single. Alice Johnson has a couple kids, right? So it's going to then give basically more allowance automatically to Alice. And what these amounts represent, too, is it's saying, okay, Based on the fact that you want to cover 100% of gold plans or better benefits, here's how much everybody would need to reasonably afford the gold plans in their area. So if I click on see plans, go down, it's going to then show that. Here are some of the options in terms of, like, what they could afford. So in this case, it's showing that there's some bronze plans they'll be able to afford, some that are a little bit more expensive, and it will also show what the employee contribution is on their side, if they one. All right, and oh, can you go back one screen? \nVandre:\nYeah, okay, so that's showing you all the yeah. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nThis also, too, is an abbreviated version of the view. So if you actually wanted to get a full view and just kind of spot check based on you know what. Just to see what the plan options would be for your employee, you could go over to this page. So this is, that's dot com slash plans. Not too hard to find. Basically, what you could do here is put in some information and then it would show you what the plans are available in your employees area. Yeah, we actually do it now. I'm thinking it for Maryland. Why not? So if we just pick an employee real quick, and then what's a good Zip code for you? \nVandre:\nSo I'm two, one, seven, six, nine. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOK, cool. So this is... Obviously a fake employee, but this just kind of goes into showing what the premiums would be for somebody who is pretty young and single, working at the company. And actually, yeah, Maryland tends to be much more affordable than other states, which is kind of nice as far as that goes. With premiums that are, you know, we can. Right now, we have it sorted by lowest deductible. So there are some zero dollar deductible plans with also pretty low premiums in the area. And if we go to, Um, let's say lowest premium, we can also search by that and find low premium plans with higher deductibles, too. \nVandre:\nSo the amounts that we're, the budgets that we're contributing, is there rules around when you can change those amounts? Is it like once per year or can we adjust that throughout the year? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, great question. So it is once per year. So you would select that once a year. And that's the budget that you'd have for the entire year. One thing I can check on with Anikra is that you may be able to create new classes if you want to throughout the year. That's getting a little bit into the weeds of things. But I can check on that. Because you're planning on hiring more folks throughout the year, right? Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I can check on that for you. Basically, what an accurate... \nVandre:\nIt's not like, if we realize our health benefits aren't being really competitive enough to attract who we want, can we bump up the contribution or do we have to figure that out in advance? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah. That is something that would be better to figure out in advance now and have in place for the year, just because the thing is, you can go, it's almost like you can go, you can go forward, but you can't go back. But you also need to have something in place, depending on when you're planning on hiring folks. Another option, though, I will say, is that you can also add the Icra at any point in time during the year. So, adding an Icra to your company automatically sets off a special enrollment period. So it almost is like a qualifying life event, if you will, which. Basically means everyone at the company can then re-enroll in insurance through you, which is nice. The only thing that that does sometimes drive, though, or one of the issues, is that. If you are on a plan with a deductible, right, and you're working towards that deductible and then you switch coverage, most of the time, that deductible does get lost. So it's something that we recommend doing is doing this at the beginning of the year, just to make sure that if people are contributing and working towards a deductible, they can make sure that doesn't get lost there. \nVandre:\nSo the icra is specifically, that is your business effectively. So you're saying we could come back in the middle of the year, add this and reset. Correct. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah. So you could, you could add this in the middle of the year, in which case, you would then basically just add the Icra then. And then at that point, offer the amounts now, or the amounts then to all the employees for their allowances. You can do that, too. \nVandre:\nAnd that can happen at any point. So we could switch off our our current offerings and switch over to Fudge. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nCorrect, Yes, you got it, as long as, um, you're not currently on another ICHRA. That's the only nuance. But in that case, though, you can definitely do that. So stay on the same offerings and then switch later on. That definitely works. Right. \nVandre:\nYeah, that's a good overview. This is interesting. I think it's a compelling option. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, I would say, honestly, like, I mean, the good thing is you're based in Maryland. Not all states are made equal in terms of. States that happen to have better rates for Iniqura. Maryland happens to be a really great one, just because obviously the individual market there is a lot less expensive than small group. But um, that being said, though, basically what my recommendation is from here on out for you? Actually? Yeah. So quick question Are you looking mostly for a one one coverage start date, or are you flexible on when to start? \nVandre:\nSo we're in the renewal period for our current gusto plans and we need to figure out what we're going to do. I mean, so in theory, we could switch to individual ACA plans and just hold off until we make more hires and then add something like this. We do have the one employee, but it's the daughter of my business partner, so we have, oh, perfect. It's not like we can decide what we do with that one. Yeah. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nAnd is she young enough to be a dependent in that case, too? \nVandre:\nNo, she's 28. Okay, she needs her own plan. Um, it's interesting you said that we can. We can write off the because that was. That was something I didn't realize. So we can purchase on the individual market and still write that off as a business expense. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYes. Yeah, definitely. I was going to say, yeah, it's, it's, it's really great. Definitely contact your CPA before doing that. Not a legal tax advisor. However, yes, for past their entities, you can, you can do that. So it is a nice perk. Right. \nVandre:\nThis is great. I don't have any other questions right now. If I can email you or set up another call, if we decide to go forward with it, then that would be, I need to go talk to my business partner, but I think this is enough information to get rolling. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nAll right, perfect. Yeah, so in that case, next steps on my end look like. I will send over basically a summary of what we covered today, as well as a lot of the links I sort of shared. Slash kind of just said verbally, so that you have all that in one place to also use. Biggest to do is honestly, or first of all, I know you already made a quote, but check it out, play around with it. Also, look at the plan options available just so that you feel comfortable with what you'd have. \nVandre:\nI'm still, like, a little confused about because the rate seemed lower than when we went to the marketplace ourselves and looked for our families. So I'm kind of a little confused about. That, like, they should be the same effectively, right? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nSo the thing is, they're going to be similar, but not exactly the same. There is usually a little bit of discrepancy between off exchange versus on exchange. In some states, it's a little bit more pronounced, which, you know, it just it's kind of just one of those things that happens. I'm not exactly sure how or why that usually happens, but it's just the way that the carriers do the pricing. So I wouldn't be shocked if it is different. That does sometimes happen. Generally speaking, though, the plans do mirror the exchange, but there can be discrepancies. \nVandre:\nWhen we go in and put in our employees, put in their ages, it shows the plans and the rates. Those are the actual rates that they're going to be charged, correct? So they can buy that plan at that price. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYes, exactly. Yeah, and it will show you, too, when you do the quote, what... Your employer contribution would be depending on what you said, and then what the employee contribution would be, too. \nVandre:\nYeah, and the way to get to that more complex screen that you had was like, the just start now. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nExactly. Yeah. So just go that shop, start now. And then you click a company account and it would take you through like a quick sign up. Like I mentioned before, though, it's just kind of there to make you go through it. But you don't have to continue with that once you're in. Main point being just get onto the quoting tool. Then once you're there, that's when you can make the more sophisticated quoting tool and actually see like. What the plan options would be and also be able to, like, really kind of set what the allowance structure is that you'd want. \nVandre:\nGreat. Yeah. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nAll right. Perfect. Well, I will plan to loop back with you. Oh, one last thing to put on your radar as far as starting 1-1 goes, if that is of interest, the only issue or not issue, But thing to keep in mind is our timeline is coming to a bit of a crunch. So the last day to register as a company with Thatch is the 19th. So end of week. With the last day for employees to enroll in plans for 1-1 by the 28th. So just to put that on your radar, so you have it. \nVandre:\nWe have to start on it because our current plans go through February 1st. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOh, okay. \nVandre:\nSo does that give us another month? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nIt does give you another month, yeah. So not too much of a crunch time, then, in that case. But yeah, definitely something I know. With the holidays and stuff, things are going to start to move a little quick. So definitely something to keep in mind, but not a end of week. At deadline, there. \nVandre:\nOkay, great. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nAll right, perfect. Well, thanks for taking the time, Mike. Again, I'll follow up with links and info, and I'll plan to loop back with you in a little bit, probably later this week, early next week. And just ask if you had a chance to run it by your business partner and what he thinks of it there. \nVandre:\nOkay. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nAll right, perfect. All right, have a great one. Bye. \n",

KEY DISCUSSION POINTS\n\nCompany Overview & Benefits Interest\n- Company Size: Small organization with 3 full-time US employees, several part-time US employees, and full-time employees in Croatia\n- Current Situation: Employee in Philadelphia inquired about QSEHRA, prompting this exploratory conversation about benefits options\n- Primary Focus: Understanding differences between ICHRA and QSEHRA to determine best fit for their team\n\nICHRA vs QSEHRA Comparison Discussed\n- ICHRA Benefits:\n  - No IRS-imposed contribution limits (vs QSEHRA's capped amounts)\n  - Pre-tax allowances for both employer and employee\n  - Plans available through Thatch platform (off-exchange state marketplace plans)\n  - Compliance documentation handled by Thatch\n  - Thatch manages enrollment and premium payments\n  - Can be implemented at any time during the year\n\n- QSEHRA Benefits:\n  - More flexibility in fund usage (can apply to spouse's employer plan)\n  - Employees can use funds for out-of-pocket medical expenses\n  - IRS-imposed contribution limits per individual/family\n\n- Critical Limitation Identified: ICHRA allowances cannot be applied to spouse's employer-sponsored plan (QSEHRA can)\n\nAffordability & Subsidy Concerns\n- Key Issue: Enhanced premium tax credits expiring in 2026; income-based subsidies remain\n- Affordability Rule: ICHRA deemed affordable if employee spends <10% of annual salary on lowest-cost silver plan\n- Family Plan Complexity: Affordability calculated on individual basis but impacts family plan eligibility for marketplace subsidies\n- Cannot Combine: ICHRA/QSEHRA allowances cannot be combined with government subsidies\n\nImportant Policy Notes\n- Entity Type: VenuePilot is C-Corp (Justin confirmed), allowing owner participation in ICHRA/QSEHRA\n- Class Requirements: Must offer benefits to all employees within same class (all full-time or all salaried)\n- Qualifying Life Events: Having a child allows plan changes mid-year\n\n2. STAKEHOLDERS IDENTIFIED\n\nVenuePilot Team\n- Justin Kantor - CEO, C-Corp owner\n  - Role: Primary decision-maker\n  - Current Status: Not currently seeking coverage for himself, potentially in future\n  - Responsibilities: Final approval on benefits strategy\n\n- Catherine Hoffman - Operations lead (\"doer of all things venue pilot\")\n  - Role: Key stakeholder in benefits implementation\n  - Current Status: Coming off parent's health insurance end of 2025 (turning 26)\n  - Already set up on New York marketplace with income-based subsidies\n  - Responsibilities: Day-to-day benefits coordination\n\n- Philadelphia Employee (name not disclosed)\n  - Location: Pennsylvania\n  - Current Status: On spouse's employer-sponsored health insurance\n  - Family: Spouse + potentially child on the way\n  - Key Consideration: May not benefit from ICHRA if spouse's plan is superior; QSEHRA might be better option due to flexibility\n\n- Third Employee (Vera - mentioned briefly)\n  - Status: Unknown if coverage needed\n\nThatch Team\n- Monica Hirschheimer - Sales/Benefits Consultant\n  - Responsibilities: Education, plan comparison, implementation guidance\n  - Committed to providing plan lists, affordability calculations, and family plan research\n\n3. CRITICAL MILESTONES & TIMESTAMPS\n\nDecember 16, 2025 (Meeting Date):\n- Initial discovery call completed\n- ICHRA vs QSEHRA education provided\n- Identified key decision factors for VenuePilot's specific situation\n\nEnd of 2025:\n- Catherine's parent's health insurance coverage expires\n- Catherine already prepared with marketplace plan for January 1, 2026\n\n2026:\n- Enhanced premium tax credits expire (confirmed today per Monica)\n- Income-based subsidies remain available\n\nPotential Implementation Timeline:\n- January 1, 2026: Possible start date (tight timeline)\n- February 1, 2026: More realistic implementation date (decision needed by mid-January 2026)\n- Note: ICHRA can be implemented any time during year\n\n4. NEXT STEPS WITH DEADLINES\n\nImmediate Actions (By End of December 2025):\n\nVenuePilot Responsibilities:\n1. Gather Philadelphia Employee Information (Justin/Catherine)\n   - Confirm current insurance arrangement with spouse's employer\n   - Determine willingness to switch from spouse's plan\n   - Understand spouse's plan quality and costs\n   - Confirm family composition (spouse + expected child)\n   - Deadline: Before next conversation\n\n2. Clarify Third Employee Status (Justin/Catherine)\n   - Determine if Vera needs health insurance coverage\n   - Confirm coverage status (spouse, other source, etc.)\n   - Deadline: Before next conversation\n\n3. Assess Catherine's Subsidy Situation (Catherine)\n   - Calculate if ICHRA allowance would be more beneficial than current income-based subsidies\n   - Review current marketplace plan costs\n   - Deadline: Before next conversation\n\nThatch Follow-up Actions (Monica):\n\n1. Send Follow-up Email (Immediate)\n   - Resources comparing ICHRA vs QSEHRA\n   - Article outlining key differences\n   - Plan availability information for Pennsylvania\n\n2. Research Family Affordability Rules (Within 1 week)\n   - Clarify how affordability calculations work for family plans\n   - Provide specific guidance for Philadelphia employee's situation\n   - Determine impact on marketplace subsidies for families\n\n3. Provide Plan Lists (Upon request)\n   - Pennsylvania marketplace plans available through Thatch\n   - New York marketplace plans for Catherine\n   - Cost estimates based on employee ages/locations\n\nDecision Point (Mid-January 2026):\n- If pursuing February 1, 2026 implementation: Final decision needed by January 15, 2026\n- If pursuing January 1, 2026 implementation: Immediate decision required (very tight timeline)\n\nConditional Next Steps:\n\nIf Moving Forward:\n- Schedule product demonstration with Monica\n- Walk through contribution decision process\n- Review Thatch platform functionality\n- Complete compliance documentation\n- Connect Thatch with Deal (payroll system) for pre-tax deductions\n\nIf Not Moving Forward:\n- Consider post-tax stipend alternative (taxable for both employer/employee)\n- Revisit in future as company grows\n\nOPEN QUESTIONS & CONSIDERATIONS\n\n1. Philadelphia Employee: Will spouse's employer plan remain superior to marketplace options?\n2. Affordability Impact: How will family affordability rules affect Philadelphia employee's subsidy eligibility?\n3. Budget: What contribution amount is VenuePilot willing/able to provide per employee?\n4. QSEHRA Alternative: Should VenuePilot explore QSEHRA vendors if spouse's plan flexibility is critical?\n5. Owner Coverage: Will Justin want coverage in near future, affecting plan design?\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES\n\n- VenuePilot uses Deal for payroll (confirmed integration capability with Thatch)\n- Company appears cost-conscious and methodical in decision-making\n- Strong emphasis on ensuring benefits actually help employees vs. creating financial burden\n- Monica demonstrated strong product knowledge and willingness to research complex scenarios\n- Conversation tone: Educational, collaborative, no pressure tactics\n\nRisk Factors:\n- Small group size means individual employee situations heavily influence decision\n- Mixed employee situations (subsidies, spouse coverage) complicate one-size-fits-all approach\n- Timing pressure if targeting January 1, 2026 start date\n\nOpportunity Factors:\n- C-Corp structure allows owner participation\n- Company growing and thinking proactively about benefits\n- Strong relationship-building in initial call\n- Clear pain point: Employee requested benefits information"

            "transcript": "Monica Hirschheimer:\nHi there, how are you guys? \nJustin Kantor:\nGreat, how are you, Monica? \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nDoing well, great to meet you both. I can only guess that you're a musician, if that's what's in your background. Yep. That's amazing, and that looks like a cello and a piano, maybe? \nJustin Kantor:\nYeah, the piano, Catherine's actually the pianist. I use the piano as a cello stand. Oh, I love that, great, amazing. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nWell, certainly. Two more instruments than I play, which is zero. Well, it's great to be you both. I would love to hop into learning about your organization, the employees you've got. You obviously reach out to us. You have some questions about benefits and maybe getting them started with your team. So I'm happy to answer questions and go through info on that, but would love to start with you guys on your roles and more about your company. Great. \nJustin Kantor:\nYeah, I'm the CEO in Catherine. She's the doer of all things venue pilot. And yeah, I guess I'll let Catherine take it from here. Yeah. \nCatherine Hoffman:\nSo we have, it's a pretty small company, at least in the US. We have now three full-time employees, but we have a few part-time employees in the U.S. and we have some more full-time in Croatia. Um, but yeah, we have one employee in Philadelphia who was asking about, I think it's QHRSA. I don't know. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nQHRSA, yeah, you're right. \nCatherine Hoffman:\nYeah, he was asking about that because he knows some other people at smaller companies who use that, and it's worked for them. So we just wanted to go over like some options that we might have. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nYep, sure. \nCatherine Hoffman:\nI know that for some... Like a lot of options, you kind of need more, like full-time employees on the team. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nSo I just wasn't sure, yeah, um, one one thing about, um, the type, the different types of Hras you. There's really no minimum unless some other company has a minimum participation, but you don't need to have any minimum participation. Um, I work with, uh, small businesses all the time and enroll just one person, So. There's no minimum there. Anyone can really bring it on to their group. What that administers is something really similar to QSERA. It's called an ICRA. And there are some differences between the two. And the icra is IC, HRA, individual Coverage. And it's very similar to QSERa in that a QSERA and an IcRa are both pre-tax allowances that you, as the employer, are providing to your employees to go toward their healthcare premiums. And maybe sometimes other out-of-pocket expenses, depending on how you're able to use those funds. But with a QSEHRA, there are limitations to how much money you can give. And that's per the I.R.S guidelines. With an ICRA, there's no limitation. You can, if you wanted to, I guess, well, I've never seen this, you can give someone $10,000 every month. That would be a first for me. But also, what was the other thing I was going to say? I think I was gonna say, oh, And the all of the dollars from the Icra are going towards everyone's individual plan. So, this person in Philadelphia and Pennsylvania would go to their state marketplace. Or find an individual plan on Thatcher's platform and use those dollars towards their individual plan. Furious, mentioned one person in Philadelphia. The other two individuals, would they need health insurance coverage? Are they covered already through a spouse, or would you be offering it to them as well? \nCatherine Hoffman:\nI'm not sure about Vera. Justin, Maybe, you know. And then I'm actually about to be off my dad's health insurance at the end of this year. Got it. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nGot to make two, for sure. \nCatherine Hoffman:\nYeah. But I was actually wondering, so for IKRA, I know that for... QSEHRA, That doesn't add on to any subsidies through the ACA marketplace? Is that the same? \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nIt's correct. That's the same with an Icra as well. We just got word today, officially, the enhanced premium tax credits will not be extended. They will 100% expire in 2026. What still stays, though, as a subsidy are those income-based subsidies. So I don't know 100% the calculation, But if you make below a certain amount of the poverty level or something, you might be eligible for an income-based subsidy. And still, that kind of subsidy, you cannot combine the two. So, between you and your PA employee, and then a third person, does anyone currently get income-based subsidies? \nJustin Kantor:\nI want to just pause because there's a lot of acronyms being thrown around and I'm actually not as familiar. How do you spell QSERA? \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nGood question. \nJustin Kantor:\nIt's Q-S-E-H-R-A. Q-S-E? \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nExactly. H-R-A. \nJustin Kantor:\nOkay. I guess my question, I just, the ICHRA, which I did a little research on before the call, because it's all I was aware of, what I learned is that it makes perfect sense, except if an employee, and one of our employees has a spouse and a family, so the ICHRA might actually not be as beneficial. If certain, if there's too much benefit for him, then, like health and plan, the affordability, I don't know if that's, is that something that you're aware of? \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nGood question. As far as do you mean, like, since they're individual plans and he needs a family plan, is that what you're saying? Correct. \nJustin Kantor:\nThere's the, yeah, the affordable ACA affordability percentage, I guess it's called. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nGreat question. Okay, so two things there. So if someone has a family, they want to have dependence on their plan, you can still get a ACA compliant plan, whether it's through Thatch or it's through your state's marketplace. So to use your ICRA allowance, that pre-tax allowance every month, you can have your, let's just say $500 per month, go towards a plan just for yourself. Or, if you also need dependence on your plan, that amount would also go towards your family plan, too. So obviously, a family plan would be more expensive than an individual plan, But any dollar amount that the employer decides to provide to the employee, either covering dependents or not, and at whatever percentage you decide as the employer, any allowance you provide your employee would go towards a family plan. For sure. \nJustin Kantor:\nThat I understood, but I guess the challenge is that the... The first, if. If you're on the health market and you're applying for a family plan, there is certain discounts that the health market will provide based on your income. Discount makes sense if you're an individual to, to waive the discount and get the ICRA. But if, if you are in a family, it ends up being that not having the Icra ends up being a more of a discount. Is that something that you come across, or? \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nYes, that's a great question, too. So, like, on the affordability side of things. So I don't know what the calculation is on the family side, but I'm sure someone on my team could provide that information for me. So, like for an individual, your allowance through FAB or through an Icra is deemed affordable if you're spending less than 10% on a low cost silver plan for the entire year. Less than 10% of your salary. On a low-cost silver plan for the entire year. In FATCH, when you are determining allowances, Fatch will actually calculate, is this an affordable allowance or not? And if you are providing someone, I'm just making this up, like $100 a month, that's probably technically unaffordable. That's pretty low, especially in Pennsylvania and in the Philly area, too. So it would say, this is unaffordable. Maybe you might... Qualify for a tax subsidy if you're an individual. I don't know how it works on the family side, because you're like, you're saying there might be like, even more of a discount. If you have a family. And depending on your income, you might actually get a subsidy from the government. And so am I. Are we on the same page here, right? \nJustin Kantor:\nYeah, I guess the if you are giving too much in, or I shouldn't say too much. If you're getting a high Icarus, then it could potentially prevent the affordable allowance, which is maybe still worth it as an individual, because it's a high enough amount. But when you start looking at a family plan, that apparently it's based off of the affordability as an individual. So you would lose the affordability in the family plan, which would then sort of negate the value of it. So, I guess- Right, right, right. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nI see what you're saying. \nJustin Kantor:\nAnd then I don't know, is what is the different? is that. Is that, I guess, is that true with that? Or would that be the same thing? Probably. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nAnd I don't know the exact like details on the affordability, but I, what you're saying is kind of making sense to me. So I need to check on the family side, But if you, whether it was an individual or a family. And you technically were given an unaffordable allowance from that, you go to the state marketplace. If you're given an affordable allowance from Thatch, or, you know, the employer decides to give you an affordable allowance, something deemed affordable, then you have no choice but to go through the Icra with your employer. Basically, the government saying, well, if you're your employer is giving you enough money to pay for a low cost Silver plan or anything else, why do we have to pay for you? We don't want to give you a discount through the marketplace. That's basically what they're saying. I don't know, on the family side. Is the person in Pennsylvania the one with the family? \nJustin Kantor:\nYeah. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nGot it. Okay. And how many dependents does that person have? \nJustin Kantor:\nIt's a wife. I mean, I don't know if I'm, I think there might be a child on the way. Got it. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nOkay. Okay. Got it. So definitely one person has one dependent. Maybe another. Yeah. So, and obviously, having a child is a qualifying life event. So they, anyone who brings on a plan and maybe is expecting, would want to choose a plan that would work for them. Also, when they have a child and then they have a qualifying life event to bring a child on. Maybe you can change a plan around that time. I'm not a hundred percent sure, but it's certainly a qualifying life event to bring a child onto a plan. So. Okay, so I guess I would be really curious to find out the family affordability stuff from the team on the legal and policy side on my end. And how that might affect your employee. And this employee in Pennsylvania, they don't have insurance currently, or maybe they have it through the state marketplace. Do you happen to know? \nJustin Kantor:\nI think they have it through his... Wife's company at this point, I think. Got it. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nOkay. That might be an important thing to think about because, or to find out, because you cannot use an Icra allowance to go towards your spouse's plan. So if you give this person $500 and he says, great, I'll put it towards what my wife's paying for me on her plan. At Google, for example, then you can't do that. With Accusera, you can. We don't administer QSARAs, but sometimes in that case, like, you need insurance for, let's say, one person. And they're not looking to come off their spouse's plan, then maybe a Qsara might be a better option. Because they have that flexibility to put that money towards the plan that they're already on with their spouse, if it's a good plan. I guess my question would be, for this person, are they willing to come off their spouse's plan? And what are the available plans and thatch that might work for them? So I can send you a plan list that might be helpful. And then also so that the employee can actually see what plans are available to them, because maybe they say, oh, God, these, these plans are no good. We're getting a great deal on what what my spouse is getting. Maybe it's like a gold plan. They're paying basically nothing out of pocket. Who knows? So I feel like that might be the next step. \nJustin Kantor:\nOK, so I'm just learning about the QSERA. So I don't really know what, what. What would be the reason to choose one over the other? How does that work? \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nThat's a great question. And I'll also send you an article we have on our platform with outlining some differences. So the QSera has a little less flexibility in the amount of money that you can provide. So if you had a little bit of a bigger budget and you wanted to give more to employees, And there's a certain range, like, based on the IRS, you know, you can only give a certain amount. Per year to an individual, a certain amount per year for a family. So if you want to be more flexible in the amount of money you want to give, you should go with an ICRA. If you want to be able to have your employees put their money towards a spouse's plan, they might be on, which in this case that's possible, then Qsehra is the option. You cannot do that with an ICRA. The other thing was the other main thing. You can put your funds for both towards out-of-pocket medical expenses. You don't have to necessarily choose a medical plan first. At least with FATCH, you have to choose a medical plan first. So maybe someone says, I don't really want to choose a medical plan. I don't need insurance or something. But with Accusera, you have a little more flexibility in how you use the allowance. The only other thing I would say the difference is with Accusera, you're going straight to the state marketplace. Finding a plan that works and then submitting reimbursement for that plan. Whereas in Icra, through FATCH, there are plans available on Batch's platform. So it's all internal as far as money goes between the employer's bank account and FATCH. So the employee is not going out to the state marketplace if they don't want to. They can find plans directly in the platform that we broker from the state marketplace. Any other questions? And I kind of give you, like some of my other thoughts I have. \nJustin Kantor:\nI only have one last question. And then I'll shut up and let Catherine answer. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nNo, it's all good. \nJustin Kantor:\nWould you say the plans through thatch? Is it because it's a larger group? Are you able to sort of compete with the state, marketplace and affordability? \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nGreat question. Great question. No, the rates that you'll see in Thatch and the plan option you'll see in Thatch are all the same. Like the rates or the costs. We'll mirror those in the state marketplace, because these the plans that you'll see in thatch are all state plans. It's just they're called off exchange because they are off of the state exchange. They're not available when you go look and go to like like Penny, which is in Pennsylvania, or the New York State exchange. When you go to the State Exchange online through healthcare.gov, those are all on exchange plans. Those are available for anyone to get. What makes something off exchange and batch is basically our ability to broker the plans with the insurance companies on our platform. But the rates are all the same because those are determined between the state and the insurance carrier. So, just as an example, if Blue Shield went up 4% in Pennsylvania, that'll be the case for the Blue Shield plans on that platform and on Pennsylvania State's marketplace. \nJustin Kantor:\nAnd they match not just the price, but all the other... \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nLike deductible out of pocket and stuff and coverage. Usually, yeah, they're going to be pretty similar. Like, the main difference we see is like, sometimes group plans are like a way better option. Sometimes, depending on cost savings and flexibility you have, I could see a super low deductible and a pretty low out of pocket for way less than you would get on the marketplace. But it all depends on state, how many people you have in your plan, the ages of the people on your plan. It's all different. I would expect it to be pretty similar as far, like at least in the Philadelphia area for this one employee. I'd expect them to have a good number of plans because it's a metropolitan area, so I wouldn't really be concerned about plan options. Cost, it just depends on how much they're willing to spend because they are in a metropolitan area. I'd expect it to be a little more expensive. Like the Middle of Nowhere Montana or something, or middle of nowhere Texas, you know, certainly not as much as New York. I'm from New York, so I don't expect that. But we could look at a few things as far as, like what the costs might be for this individual. We have a system where you can look at plan options. You could send this to the employee. They could let you know if maybe they see some plans that would work for them or not. But my thinking is potentially, if their spouse is on a group plan and that's where they have their insurance, it's very possible that the spouse has better group insurance than they would get from the state marketplace. Got it. \nJustin Kantor:\nAll right. Just one very last question. And then I... Sure, so if everything is kind of in the state marketplace, what is Thatch's offering? \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nYeah, that's a great question. Great question. I probably get the question, like, once a week, like, why would we even go through this? So there are two things. First, when you're going through Thatch, everything is a pre-tax allowance, because it's administering the ICRA, which gives the employer the ability to do it pre-tax. Also, the... Contributions on the employee side would also be pre-tax. So pre-tax for everyone, no payroll taxes for that. The other thing with Thatch is that Thatch will do all the compliance documentation for you. So the fact that you're offering an ICRA, whatever tax documentation you need to show that, then we would do that for you, the compliance side. And then when individuals choose plans through Thatch, they're choosing the plan on Thatch, and then Thatch is actually enrolling them in the plan. We are. Putting that forward to the insurance carrier. So no one has to go to their state marketplace and call up and make sure the enrollment went through. So we do all of that for them. And then we also pay the premiums on behalf of the employees. We do that by connecting with the employer's bank account. So that's the main thing. So it's like a one-stop shop for everything and for everyone within the company, both the employee and the employer, hoping to lessen the burden of going to the employee state, the state marketplace and having the flexibility to choose any plan you want. But we try to keep it in-house. We have services to help employees choose plans if they want. They're welcome to use that service, which I always try to recommend, because choosing a health plan is very confusing. Yeah, we just try to make it as easy as possible for the employees. And then take the burden off the employer while they're, you know, offering some kind of benefit to their employee. \nJustin Kantor:\nOkay, I guess that's, that's great. I get everything now. And now I'll let Catherine continue the conversation. \nCatherine Hoffman:\nI just had a question about, so on thatch, is there an option for a part of our payroll to go pre-tax towards our premium payment for that month? \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nSo if you're making this up, and tell me if I'm on the same page as you, If you're going to give your employees $500 per month and the employee chooses a plan, that's $600 per month. So your $500 would go towards the employee's premium, and then the employee would have a $100 payroll deduction, right? Because their premium is $100 more expensive than the allowance you provide them that month. So then that $100 would be a pre-tax. Payroll deduction directly through Thatch, We'll calculate that for you. Um, what? uh, payroll system. Oh, use Deal for a payroll. Yeah, yeah. So then that would be an automatic deduction, so Deal and Thatch would be connected to each other, and Thatch would send over the deduction. So you know exactly when it's going to be deducted and how much is going to be deducted per paycheck? Okay, did that answer your question? \nCatherine Hoffman:\nYeah. So if we're going through thatch, do we have to use an Icra, or could we also use a Qsera through that? \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nWe don't offer QSERAs. We don't administer QSERAs. We strictly administer ICRAs. So if a QSera is a better option for you, which it could be. If your employee gets his insurance through his wife's plant, through his wife's company, and is not willing to change from his wife's company, that could be good benefits. So then I would say a QSera might be a better option, because a QSera allows you to have those funds, those pre-tax dollars go towards a spouse's plan. \nCatherine Hoffman:\nOkay. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nWhere Nicra does not. \nJustin Kantor:\nAnd you can only have one of the two, right? I can't have some employees in one. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nCorrect. Exactly. Yeah. Good question. Yeah. Any other questions you guys have? These are all great questions, by the way. Love it. Really like testing my QSAR knowledge here. \nJustin Kantor:\nI've never heard of it until this call. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nGreat. Amazing. Where are you guys based, by the way? \nJustin Kantor:\nWe're in New York. Yeah, we're both in New York. You're both in New York. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nI wasn't 100% sure. I saw behind Justin. I was like, that could be like New York City apartment. I don't know. I'm not really sure. \nJustin Kantor:\nWhoreham Hill. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nI'm usually based on Long Island. I'm out of town this week, but I'm usually in Long Island. And Justin, if you were to, whether it's Ick or Kucera, would you be looking for insurance for yourself as well as the owner or no? No, it won't. \nJustin Kantor:\nProbably won't be necessary, potentially in the future. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nOkay. \nJustin Kantor:\nAnd it would probably also, would that also apply for me as an owner, like either the Icra or the QSERA, if I can? \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nAre you an s-corp or a C-Corp? C-Corp. Then C-Corp you can. S-corp owners, partnership owners, sole proprietorship owners, they cannot accept the ICRA or QSERA benefit. Because that's this pre-tax allowance, and being one of those other types of owners, then you get other tax benefits. So C-Corp owner, you're good to go. \nJustin Kantor:\nYou'll be fine. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nYeah. \nJustin Kantor:\nYeah. All right. That's good to know. Yeah. So, maybe. Yeah. I guess. And so the real difference between Icra and Qsehra is the amount. And so we can go higher with it. And the other, so that's the plus with ICRA. The plus with the Cusera is that there's a little bit more flexibility in how it's applied. I think you're, Catherine, is that happening for you, too? The audio, I think, is starting to, is that just on my end, or is it yours, Catherine? \nCatherine Hoffman:\nNo, I think it kind of sounds like it's like underwater a little. \nJustin Kantor:\nIt just disconnected, I think, maybe. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nHow about now? Is it a little better now? Perfect, yeah. \nJustin Kantor:\nOkay, good. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nSorry about that. What were you saying? Okay. \nJustin Kantor:\nSo I'm just trying to understand the difference between the two. Is there any other significant? \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nThose are really the main ones. Let me pull up. One thing and see if I'm forgetting anything. \nJustin Kantor:\nAnd yeah, so for QSEHRA, like, it doesn't impact the affordability of the plan in this, or it still does? \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nIt still could. Because it's still a pre-tax allowance. So it's very possible, because either way. Whether you do an Icra or a QSERA, you can't combine them with subsidies, so the affordability would still have an impact. I see. \nJustin Kantor:\nOkay. Yeah. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nIt sounds like you're looking into this for a specific individual who asked about it. If you went one direction, you decided to go with a Qsera or an ICRA, You would need to offer it to everyone, as long as they're all full-time or they're all salaried. You have to offer it to everyone within the same class. But it kind of sounds like maybe the decision would be based on whether this is a good option for this one employee. Or even like an option with Catherine. I think you said you were coming off your parents plan. When? when do you turn 26, or when will that expire? \nCatherine Hoffman:\nIt's the end of this year. This year. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nGot it. OK. So have you set yourself up in New York to choose a plan for January 1st? \nCatherine Hoffman:\nI set myself up already. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nOK, good. Great. I think. \nCatherine Hoffman:\nMy subsidies are probably a little better than the other employees, just because of the payment, like the yeah and on the on the UM income-based subsidies. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nRight? Yeah, yeah, okay, got it, yeah, so I would, yeah, I mean, you know, offering an Icarus Sarah is it's wonderful. But if for some reason, um, like you're getting a subsidy that I don't know you, your insurance is going to be $200 a month. But then you get. An Icra or Qsera allowance that's actually going to make you pay more out of pocket, sometimes those are not as great. So it sounds like you guys have a small enough group where you could kind of like, figure out, is this going to be good for everyone? Is it going to hurt some people? And maybe getting some more information from the Pennsylvania employee to get an idea of what will actually work? And then at the end of the day, sometimes people just do post tax stipends, you know, that, because it's just it makes more sense for them in those scenarios. \nJustin Kantor:\nWhat's that? A post-tax stipend? \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nYeah, like if literally an employer just decides to give everyone an extra $100 a month for, you know, putting to go towards their health care. And that would be taxable. Yeah. Both for the employee and the employer. \nJustin Kantor:\nYeah, got it. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nYeah. So there are things you can figure out, but it just, it's all a pro-con kind of thing. And especially when you have a smaller group, I think it's a little easier because you can have conversations and kind of figure a few things out. \nJustin Kantor:\nGot it. Yeah. Timing wise, is this something that we have to figure out by January 1st, or is it kind of like whenever we want to? \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nGood question. Yeah, you can bring an Icra on at any point in the year. QSERA is probably, too, but I don't know the timelines for QSERA vendors. You can bring an icra on at any time. If you wanted January 1st, we still got a little bit of time for that. But I feel like for you guys, it sounds like it's not a huge rush and maybe February 1st would be. Better, so you're not like rushing too much. You would have to make a decision basically by, like, mid-January for February 1st coverage, but at least with that you can bring an anchor on at any point during the year. Okay, yeah, isn't it right? I would be really curious to hear some feedback from the other employee if you get other info. And then if you're like, Yeah, okay, maybe this will work, then I'd be happy to, like, walk you through a demonstration. How do you decide on contributions for this person and for the rest of the team. So, yeah, if you want to learn more and you get some more info on your end, then just reach out anytime and we'll go from there. Work on your timeline. Awesome. Well, thank you both for your time. Thanks for listening and thanks for all the great questions and quizzing me a bit. But I'll send you a quick follow-up email with a few resources I think might be helpful, and then reach out anytime with questions. \nCatherine Hoffman:\nThank you so much. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nYou're so welcome. Enjoy the rest of your day. Take care. Bye. \n",

            "transcript": "Ty Phillippay:\nLet's see, maybe it's better now. Let's see, it looks like it's got you on mute. \nRachel Antone:\nHey, Ty, can you hear me now? \nTy Phillippay:\nYeah, absolutely. \nRachel Antone:\nHey. Oh, I'm so sorry. I think I didn't allow it to connect to my microphone, so that was my bad. No problem. That happens. How are you today? \nTy Phillippay:\nI'm doing great. I appreciate the opportunity to. Meet you and talk to you. But first, let me understand, where am I? As far as how many interviews you've done so far with that? \nRachel Antone:\nYeah, absolutely. So this is number four right now. So I chatted with Andrew first and then Samina. So a little bit out of order there. And then just spoke with Zach yesterday. \nTy Phillippay:\nSo excellent. \nRachel Antone:\nYeah. Number four. \nTy Phillippay:\nAwesome. All right. And then, and just, I'd love to kind of find out how... You initially heard about that. Can you tell me about that? \nRachel Antone:\nYeah, absolutely. So I was actually not in the market looking for a new role, But Andrew actually posted about a role in one of the networking channels that I'm a part of for sales enablement. And I have always loved working with healthcare and really wanting to lean into like, very established industries. That are, you know, or where there are teams that, you know, are focused on modernizing certain things. So I've kind of stuck with the IT finance and healthcare world these past few years. And yeah, just decided to message Andrew. And he just shared so many interesting things about the role. So sent in an application and, you know, the rest is history. \nTy Phillippay:\nYeah. \nRachel Antone:\nAwesome. \nTy Phillippay:\nAwesome. Now, have you been a part of a... Company that was like, literally growing in every sense of the word. And what I mean by that is, when you get there, everything's kind of jumbled up, you know. There's like the right ideas are in place, but like, the standard processes aren't. And then you're just constantly trying to build and then bring in more people. Have you been in that environment before? \nRachel Antone:\nYes, I've actually been in that environment a couple of times. Actually, funny that, you know, so Zach mentioned that you were on like the Hris side. So I actually worked with a different startup called First Up a few years back, where I had to lay all of the groundwork for enablement. We were in a hyper growth phase. I think the sales team altogether, that includes SDRs and account executives, was around 30. We grew to over 100. In a year. So lots of changes, lots of breaking into new markets, and really had to kind of figure that out at that company. And actually have consulted with a few companies as well to help them get that momentum, you know, get their ducks in a row, as they're really trying to figure out, okay, there's a product market fit from a solution standpoint, but how do we bring that go to market strategy and a meaningful way to our buyers? Like, how do we take into account their ecosystem, all of their internal levers that need to be pulled? Different stakeholders, um. But also how do we like help the particular personas that we're speaking to, how do we help them win and see that they can win, you know, with our solution? And that's kind of been my main strategy in making sense of of a lot of different complex types of teams. \nTy Phillippay:\nYeah, yep. And it's it's a repeatable skill set. And what's interesting is what Bowie's found is what doesn't work at the next place. Sometimes I come in thinking like, OK, I'm going to kind of have my little playbook. I'm going to use my my analysis tool for each group that I'm analyzing. I'm going to capture my data there and then I'm going to do this. And then I'm going to hit them with this and they'll love it. And I get to that point and I'm like, they won't love this. And it wasn't even a fit. It's, you know, there's the unique. This to each organization and the speed that we're going on. But I'd say, overall, at that you, the resounding thing that I've found is just really good people. It's a huge difference maker. I've worked at United Healthcare for 20 years and, you know, ran Northern California for them, for key accounts and small group. That was very regimented. It's like you're in a space station, like the Death Star, and floating through space, you know. And then I went to a tech startup and we were just, I was the first commercial hire. It was radically different. Frankly, it was hard, it was harder than I thought the actual transition was. But with that, you think what you're finding is a company that has made it really part of its DNA. To have a rigorous hiring process and to look at an individual beyond their their resume, get to know them, take, invest that time. So what I find is, Sorry, I have a little bit of a head cold. I'm getting over. So my voice is a little scratchy. What I find is I can get a really good idea and everybody loves it. They're like, yes, we need that. Right. You know, there's full support. So not only am I empowered to share the idea, but I get great feedback. Really, the team that we're missing right now is a team that could make that great idea that's been kind of ratified or just known. Like, gosh, we need this to really just make it happen. And so what are some of the ways that you in your past felt like? You've come into an organization? You've kind of taken the amount of time you need to get marinated into what needs to happen. And but when you've really just helped an organization turn a corner by delivering what they needed, whether it was materials or messaging, or any or both. \nRachel Antone:\nYeah. Yeah. Absolutely. So I loved what you said earlier about how traditional frameworks do not work, especially in startups. But to be honest, you know, I've worked at a couple of larger companies and those frameworks don't work there either. Because of the way that the market is these days. We're in such weird economic times where, you know, things like just smacking MedPick into a deal cycle is not. The only way to win? Like there are, or like competency frameworks. Those types of systems are just too rigid for the amount of movement and the amount of things that we learn. Even on like, a quarterly basis. So I really try to actually, like, think, like a seller, if I'm supporting a sales team. Want to ask the discovery questions to the leaders, to the sales reps, to the executives, to understand, Okay. You know, sure, there's the executive strategy, the initiatives and like, the goals for the year. But what's actually going on within the individual teams? What obstacles are we running into? Um, what things are working well? Um, I think that, you know, chatting with with different folks on the team provides a lot of behavioral context. But also really want to look at the data from an operations standpoint. So what is Salesforce showing? What kind of trends can we glean from where deals are being held up, or where personas are just not getting us anywhere? So how do we change our strategy as far as qualifying who we're speaking to, who we're bringing into the conversation and when? And also what other trends we can gather from? Different accounts that are being worked. I think that it's really, really important to take into account all of those different things. So, of course, like the wants, like the desires from executive team, from leaders, from the individual teams, what is going well, what's going wrong, but then also what is data actually showing? I think that all of those different angles are extremely helpful, but then also... I like to take it upon myself to do a lot of research about the industries that I'm working in as well, so that I can bring in those new ideas. As far as like, you know, this is what this competitor is doing, and it seems to be working really well, or maybe the opposite. I think it's really important to have all of that context in mind, to know how to approach a problem. But with that being said, I think it's also really important to get those quick wins, especially like in enablement. That's not, you know. Facing role We don't make money. So, um, so understanding, okay? Like, what is the what is, what are the the like? the hierarchy of um, priorities that matter to each specific team? Um, you know, if hiring, if there's a lot of hiring on the horizon, onboarding needs to go first, but Upskilling, also very important. So how can I begin to like, bucketize different types of skills and then V2 or V3 of those skills for more tenured reps, so that I can also have them, you know, feel thought of, engaged, that programs are coming, if not right now, but, you know, in the near future. I think it's really important to kind of juggle all of those things. And I'm very good at multitasking, thinking about those. Those different players, making sure other folks feel included in the build. Because I think a lot of, a lot of enablement teams out there don't really focus on, you know, the, the, the whole spread of employees, very much focused on one, one segmented group. \nTy Phillippay:\nNow, if I were to randomly be invited to, let's say a Thanksgiving dinner, where either your family or your people that kind of know you personally and stuff. Were there, what? What sort of character traits and stuff would they give you a hard time about? Are you a type, a personality? Are you highly, you know, driven and energized? And or, you know, are you? More? I can tell, based on your communication, you're very great at communicating your thoughts and stuff. But how would they kind of encapsulate you? \nRachel Antone:\nOh, OK. I am such an energetic person. For like, at least speaking about my family, my family is very introverted, but I am such a people person. I love bringing people out of their shell, making people feel welcome and included, and not everybody wants that. But I think that sales is a really great home for me, because, um, you know, like sales people are typical, typically people, people. So, um, yeah, I will talk your ear out if you get me on the right topic. \nTy Phillippay:\nYeah. \nRachel Antone:\nYeah. \nTy Phillippay:\nAwesome. Okay. That's a good answer. And then I do like to ask, what hobbies outside of work do you find yourself doing or being interested in? I get that sometimes you don't get to do the things as much as you might be just interested in doing them, but. \nRachel Antone:\nYeah, absolutely. So I actually love creating art, art and, and like, like yoga. Those are my two favorite outlets to lean into. So I actually am a painter. So I like will do commission art paintings for, for my friends or, you know, other people that see my, my Instagram page. But yeah, I actually, I love painting and just creating. I feel like it helps me calm the analytical side of my brain down, but also keep things into perspective. I find that, you know, like the blank, the blank page theory, where, you know, if you have a blank piece of paper, it can be really, really intimidating. I get like, this is weird to say, but I get nervous every single time I start a new piece of work. But I think that just keeping things into practice, like keeping an open mind, we'll see where this ends up. If I make mistakes along the way, I'm going to make it beautiful in some way or another. And I found that that's really helps me to embrace the building process, as opposed to just appreciating, you know, the end product. \nTy Phillippay:\nYeah, that's true. And I learned a lot about painting as a kid, watching Bob Ross. \nRachel Antone:\nOh, I love Bob Ross. \nTy Phillippay:\nI would still like it stops me dead in my tracks. Just if he's on, you know, I'll just watch him. And I loved, like, because what he was a master of. Right, it's just kind of having a formula that's successful. And then he'd done it so long that he could make it accessible to even a nobody. Yeah, and that was his whole goal, right? It was not to all right. Everyone in. I'm going to now teach you the fine art of painting, you know, it's the exact opposite. It was like somebody who just could draw somebody. And then, frankly, I've never painted anything since elementary school and probably won't. It's not my, my skill, but that's cool. But what? Also what you're saying? It's it's interesting. A lot of painting people or art construction people think of as like, it's just this wild process that you black out and stuff. And not not always, but sometimes it is like brick by brick. I gotta get through this part. I'm exhausted, but I got, you know, and and then you're following this blueprint because you're layering right, just constant, it's it's a cool outlet and and medium for sure. \nRachel Antone:\nYeah, yeah, awesome, absolutely. \nTy Phillippay:\nAnd so how long have you been, like, full go painting? Is this something from young kid? You just loved it or wouldn't you really get into it? \nRachel Antone:\nSo I was always the one that was making a mess, like drawing on the walls, getting paint everywhere. So like, definitely, when I was a kid, the passion started. Um, and I just never understood why. Like, you know, whenever you got to sign up for your electives in school, like, why aren't people excited to get to sign up for art? \nTy Phillippay:\nI don't understand. \nRachel Antone:\nIt's it's so fun. But I actually was going to go to school for art. um, out of high school, but ended up chickening out. I was like, Oh, I don't know if I'll make much money doing that. So let me just do something different. Um, but I've actually made a full circle back to it. Um, I think like maybe five or six years ago, it was around when Covid started and, you know, we had all that extra time. I was like, okay, well, I guess I might as well get back into it. And it was scary because I like, want the end product to be great and perfect, but like I said before, like, really having to lean back into, if something doesn't look good, how can I make it look good? And also just looking at other artists process, seeing that there are often ugly points. And it's the pieces that end up really, really beautiful. Actually take a lot of work, a lot of layering, like you said, and a lot of like, you know, looking at the or finding the forest through the trees like a mess on a piece of paper or canvas. So Yeah. \nTy Phillippay:\nOkay. Jackson Pollock, total bullshit or one of the best? \nRachel Antone:\nI think it's so cool. I don't know. It's definitely not my style. I like things. I like stuff that makes sense, like portraits, or like bouquets, things like that, or just random objects. I think it definitely has a place though, like his colors and and what kind of message he's trying to convey. But not not what I do. \nTy Phillippay:\nI know, okay, I've always struggled with him because, like, I, I get it. I mean, I like eclectic, weird stuff, but I actually prefer it. I'm much more into kind of the outer margins, but he's always been a hard one for me. Because it's just like I even see people who poke a hole in a paint can and put it on rope in their garage and just spin it. I'm like, those are kind of cooler because like, at least there's some, at least something a layman can pick up on, some sort of like Ellipsis or whatever. \nRachel Antone:\nYeah. Yeah. There's some sense, some rhyme to the reason. \nTy Phillippay:\nYeah. Yeah. All right. Well, now what? I obviously, you know what I'm interested in. I certainly want to talk more about the job, but I wanted to ask you, what do you? How would you if you were told, OK, 10 paintings a year from now, whatever, you know, time? Enough time for you to do 10 full pieces that you're proud of? How do you determine what to charge? \nRachel Antone:\nOh, that's such a good question. So time, size, and also materials. Those are the three main things. And beyond that, like I often find that the people that I sell my paintings to, they will, they'll give me a lot more than what I actually create. And I think that... That has to do with, like, the meaningfulness, like I'm very, very intentional about the pieces that I create. Um, so, could range anywhere from like 200 to over a thousand, depending on the size, but I typically stay like middle, middle sized painting. \nTy Phillippay:\nInteresting and well, all right, I love that, I love that answer. And I, frankly, my wife's been talking about painting, and, uh, she does yoga as well. Um, we looked at what painting stuff to get, and it's a little intimidating because it's like, I don't know. How do you start? I guess you'd have to kind of start small and figure out what she liked and build up. \nRachel Antone:\nYes, yes. And with the cheap supplies that you find on Amazon, figuring out, do I like watercolor, gouache, or whatever? So, yeah. \nTy Phillippay:\nCool. Okay. And so, are you looking at other jobs at this point? Point in time? I know you responded to Andrew. Are you looking with other companies as well? \nRachel Antone:\nSo a couple of other companies have reached out to me and I am being super selective. I've only been at my current company for like almost eight months now. I know it's not my forever home. I know that there are things that are missing on the people front, on the strategy front, but like, really, really trying to find the right team that like. Is wanting to prioritize a enablement, because enablement is kind of shunted to the side in some organizations, so that's super important, um, but then also like, making sure that, um, that teams are truly empowered. I really, really care about the individual sales teams that I support. And I think that, you know, I'm seeing this all over the news, Pinterest and my friends. Um, that individual teams are not so much being considered like they. Used to when it comes to creating enablement programs. Like, I'm finding that specifically with my organization, we just got acquired by a PE firm. And executive strategy, the way that the executive strategy is, is the way that things need to be executed. And I just don't think that that is how you provide world-class enablement. That's actually going to stick and yield the results to the individual teams that there need to be. It's just like, in my opinion, like a math equation, that does not add up to a great result. \nTy Phillippay:\nYep. And then when we've been learning to make do the way that we have, we kind of have the lost boy syndrome from Peter Pan, right? We just got to make up our own rules. \nRachel Antone:\nLet's just do it this way. \nTy Phillippay:\nLet's do this today. And that's just the nature of the beast. But when we start talking about alignment with, you know, centralizing a resource, and, yeah, not commanding, but directing everybody, like, Stop the moon shining. Folks like, it worked. It's what got us to here. But now how can you bring a dynamic team that's running great guns? Like, what, what have you done in the past to get them to slow down? And then also to do the thing? Whatever it is, new material, new way to talk. And then, on the back end, what I'm most interested in, what do you do? Or how do you manage the people who are laggards in that adoption process? \nRachel Antone:\nYeah, absolutely. Okay. \nTy Phillippay:\nSo you wouldn't be managing them. I'm asking just from a more of a peer to peer relationship, not like, you know, we can all be like, Hey, you're not doing your job, But like, how can you train, bring them into the tent with the process? \nRachel Antone:\nSo I think, just like how we talk about with our customers, like, time and money matters a lot. What money is being left on the table for not very strategic activities that have been done? Maybe, like, conversations have been left on the table, you know, and we haven't. We haven't really nurtured specific leads. What is that costing us as far as our quota attainment? I really like to bring those numbers up to managers or to reps if I'm coaching a rep. But then also, like, what, what are the time sucks in our day? That, you know, are not really leading to actual like behaviors? Like everybody wants everybody time, or everybody wants time back in their day. So, like, what menial tasks is a rep doing that are really not adding up to, like quality performance. I think that those are super important to bring up a to managers. Um, you know, whenever I'm having a conversation on like performance for their team, like, how can we improve performance? Um, or, like, I said, you know, just connecting with the rep, coaching reps during the onboarding phase. Um, I think it's really like, it's really important to, like, examine what the activities and behaviors are that are working. Lean into those things. Rather than like, just kind of going blind to conversations or to engaging with a particular account. Yeah, I think strategy should always come first. \nTy Phillippay:\nYeah, and now I struggle right now in my professional career because I'm kind of, you know, hell, I'm internet. I can remember the days without it, right? And that's starting to make me a little bit more unique, especially in tech. But... I used to write these massive emails and I kind of hung my hat on it. And I would just give people like step-by-step instructions, or I would do a really nice job with screenshots and everything. We're just so dang close. Loom gets us a lot of the way there, where we can switch the modality to much more of kind of a consultative. Auditory experience with some backup documentation, But I find a lot of companies, you get to the loom or that sort of level of professionalism and it just falls off. The greater process. It's like, we're awesome. We're tech first, we're enabled. And then watch my video. And I'm like, Hey, this is Ty. You know, it's like, it's bad, production value slows us down. Have you seen ways that we can do one to many communications that are kind of a step above a loom, but we still keep the ability to go in and change that one part? Because the nuance question, because at United, we had big, big marketing budgets. And as soon as you had a good idea, they brought in marketing. And you could never change your mind about the name or any. It was like in the production mode. You're like, oh, I don't like that. This is more of a tactical tool. So I'm really looking right now for something. I mean, we see a lot of animations, right? \nRachel Antone:\nYes. Simple animations. \nTy Phillippay:\nI think those are very effective at certain times. But what else do you think we could do with technology? that's. Emerging and available to kind of cross that bridge. \nRachel Antone:\nYeah, absolutely. Okay, I love this question. I loved what you mentioned about, like the screenshots. I have worked at a couple of companies that had tools where they were actually able to like screen share. like, hey, this is a particular view of our solution. Let me show you what would be helpful for you. Like, let me show you what's different about this interface. And then that's the end. That's it. So there's an interactivity. There's almost like a bit of a demo component to it as well. On the flip side, there's so much AI out there, like automated messaging. I love you. I use ChatGPt all the time. I use Notebook LM to create podcasts for teams I work with. But I do think that the AI messaging is not at the maturity that it needs to be at. I think that's like the worst thing for. For outreach at this point until messaging features in different sites. I know outreach even has this as well. But I think that until that messaging gets smarter, it's great to just lean on those sorts of videos. I think that I actually got a few outreach messages. Can you? Can you hear me? Okay, by the way? \nTy Phillippay:\nYeah, yeah, that sounds great. \nRachel Antone:\nThe screen's, Yeah, we're good, okay, um, so I think I've actually learned a lot from SDRs that have reached out to me trying to sell me. Things like the intentionality between behind some messages that I've gotten versus others which I like, don't even respond to. But the ones that are intentional are, you know, showing me something that is valuable. Like, if if you're going to ask for time from someone, you should provide some value back. Like, there's a give and take relationship when it comes to outreach and doing sales. And yeah, I think that like bringing in the personal touch, like this. One girl who reached out to me actually was like, Oh, I saw that you're in Austin. Do you like this barbecue spot, which was like a very niche thing. I had been there and I do really like it. So I think the personalization goes far, but like the visual aids that you know would be helpful to a particular person, those matter a lot. Um, but I do think, rather than just like guessing, blindly, like, Oh, let me just show this person some random feature or some button on my website. I think that does not work. That's that's where, um, I think personalization always needs to come in. Um, especially for like, heavy hitting, uh, personas that we really want to get on the calendar. \nTy Phillippay:\nYep, yeah. And then I'm interested to see where it all goes because there's the selling piece that's very much just blueprint. How much does it cost? And everything? But there's also the human aspect. Right. And that's what we have a sales team for, and sales. You know, what you would be doing would be fueling us to be successful in those roles. Right. I don't see that going away. It'll certainly change. It would become heavily technology enabled. But, um, it's going to happen fast. Yeah, that's the. That's the one thing, you know, we're talking three to five years. Things will look incredibly different. Yeah, yeah, now where's? where's home for you? \nRachel Antone:\nUm, Austin, Texas. Actually, literally a few blocks down from where Samina said the office is. So I'm like, right in the middle of downtown. \nTy Phillippay:\nThat's, that's a lucky, a lucky break. Um, and our CEO or co-founder, founder, Chris, it's... In that office and always stuff happening there and they're definitely building a presence there. So that's cool. What questions do you have for me? They gave us 45 minutes. We probably don't need that full amount of time. I've enjoyed learning more about who you are and how you think. And so what questions about Thatch do you have? \nRachel Antone:\nOh, yes, I have a few. And was so excited to chat with you, especially after Zach gave me more information on, like, what you do in the business. So I have a few like HR, I am oriented. Questions Because I know that's your angle. So we'd love to hear in benefits and HR sales, like what you're selling at Batch, what do you think reps need to demonstrate early on in order to get credibility with the buyers that you're interacting with? \nTy Phillippay:\nI think it's right now, I think the number one thing. And it's just due to the cost of insurance is I think our lead punch needs to include cost savings. We've been hesitant to throw that as a lead punch. Because when it's not there and there are times, then you come off, as you know, scamming or weird. So we've used a lot of things like health insurance from the future or the most flexible. I mean, I think, where we just are gathering together. It's like, we're a 15 year old, right? We're starting to understand who we are, how we feel about things versus how we've been told and trained. Right. And so we just really kind of hit people with a lot of different stuff, to be honest. I've watched enough of the other reps where we're all got our, we're all figure skating, But none of it's, you know, synced up or looking the same. And so the thing that would resonate the most this year would be cost. Because where the rubber meets the road for us right now, small and mid-sized markets are getting crushed. So I would actually forego some of our standard language and more legacy language, just to be more like, you need help? We can help for 60% of employers. Give us a side door so that the ones who aren't going to work, we can quickly say, sorry, you're not part of our 60%. So that's where we should have had more of a... An attacking slant to all documentation and outreach this go-round, which is not mature enough yet. Next year, I think the piece that we've got to really, the sinker and the line that we've got to get to people is. Your groups are going to be moving to Icra with or without you. And that goes to brokers, that goes kind of to everybody, because we're very lucky and fortunate for something that's very unlucky and unfortunate, which is this cycle of pricing for small group insurance going up by 12 to 25 percent every year now moving forward. So how do we, you know, how do we help people out of that calamity? Because we really are one of the only options where they can very effectively step out of all that risk for their company. And actually give their employees more options. So it's a win for the employer, a win for the employee. So I really think, I think we have this tendency to want to say, well, now you've gotten me all tripped up. See, I'm great at asking questions, answering them directly, not so much. Because the other thing you'll notice, and I'm taking a big step back, but it matters here. Insurance is as regulated as it is. Anything can be. And it's all 50 states. It's federal. It's all kinds of ways that we could screw things up and we shouldn't do things and can't do things. And then we have built our DNA as we're a tech company, like rock and roll. Let's just sell. Let's get and we sell, you know, And we're going to have large commission structures for to really incentivize people. Just to break down their barriers and just go sell something, right? So we have to decide real fast this next year. Do we want to be the insurance solution, because then we got to adapt to more insurance language footprint? Um, professionalism, because the whole game there is like, don't worry where you go with us, we got you covered and everything. Or do we go punk? Do we just say insurance sucks we? That's bullshit. You can sell the ICHRA. You don't have to have a... Broker license, anyone can do it. And why would you even want insurance? And no, we're not going to talk to you about your contribution strategy and your participation requirements. That's insurance crap. We're the Icra baby. This is easy, or, you know what I mean? So we either have to decide are we going to be the new model. That's like, cast away all the stuff that people hate? or are we going to be kind of the new version of stuff people hate. \nRachel Antone:\nYeah. \nTy Phillippay:\nAnd my. Observation As a multi-year insurance and HR person, we're kind of hedging our bets. We don't want to get in trouble. So we're kind of insurance-ifying all of our language and our messaging, kind of, sort of. But here's a classic example that drives me nuts. If you're in group insurance and you say, send me a quote, or you send something, you get a quote, Your expectation is you will get an Apples to Apples comparison of what it will cost for an equal or, you know, lesser or slightly higher valued thing, you know, down to the census, and you can just do an analysis. Well, this one is $1,300. We can't do that with ICRA. And there's a reason because there's an employee choice piece that we can't tell what people will choose. But we still say, oh, we'll send you a quote. No, we won't. We'll actually send you a proposal because we have to send it in our own terms and we can't match what you want. And right there, brokers, if you talk to them, they'll be like, well, I can't even figure out what the hell is this thing. It doesn't line up with any of my other quotes. So I just didn't even pay attention to it. I mean, we're at that level of new. And so, just to answer your question in a long way around, I mean, the big maturation point for Thatch is next year. It's where we have to get all of our best thoughts together and agree to using a good portion of them standardly and uniformly. \nRachel Antone:\nYeah. Okay. \nTy Phillippay:\nI landed in a totally different spot, but that's observations. \nRachel Antone:\nWell, that's super helpful. I have so many things that, like, crossed my brain as you were mentioning that. So open enrollment just happened, or, like, the announcements for a lot of open enrollment, we just had it at SolarWinds. And I think, I mean, I was even more excited to talk to Andrew a few weeks ago because it was really, really sad. Hearing about all of the stress that other folks that have families or like a health care situation. Like, we just switched from, oh, my goodness, Blue Cross, Blue Shield to Cigna. And like, sure, less than what it would have been with Blue Cross, Blue Shield, but still more and way more complicated. So I just think, if there's a way to frame all of this as a. Like helping employees feel more comfortable, like, more supported with the insurance that they have, But then also be like, I know that there are certain metrics, like there's of course, there's like the, the customer satisfaction, all that, like, like the, the relationship between the solution. And like the B2B company, you know what I mean? But then there's also employee satisfaction. I wonder if those sorts of metrics can also begin to be mapped as well, because HR wants... Their employees to be using the different resources available, or else it's wasted money. \nTy Phillippay:\nYeah, and to your point, the one other thing I this one will probably resonate with you, yeah, um, we're the holder of all normative debt data for the Icra market because nobody talks about it right now. Yeah, so if if I were to come to you and say, Oh, Rachel, you're thinking of giving everybody in your photography company employees, all those underlings, a thousand dollars? That's great. That's a very healthy, uh, allowance, but did you know that's about 40 more than most small employers? Is that intentional and things like that? So that is one example. The other example is Bob's trucking, and I talked to Bob, and Bob's literally driving a truck. He's talking to me. He's like, Yeah, I need group benefits. My guy's got he's going to have twins, so we got to make sure he has benefits. And I want it for everybody else. Bob don't care. Bob just wants benefits. Let's just get Bob benefits as simply and as clearly and as well as we can. But we have a tendency. Oh, Bob, let's have a meeting. Let's discuss it. Bob's driving a truck. He doesn't want to have another meeting. Right. \nRachel Antone:\nYou know, I mean, so, yeah. \nTy Phillippay:\nIt's wild because I think you and I think about the world a lot. I'm very systemic thinker of like, well, if we mess around over there, the counterbalance is over here. You know, like, everything's attached, not always directly. There's just going to be some tremendous improvements that are attainable finally, this next year. Really maturation points. \nRachel Antone:\nYeah. Okay. Well, that's super helpful context. I really appreciate you sharing that. I think that, yeah, like, as I was also studying for this interview, like, I'm like trying to, like, wrap my head around. The go-to-market situation, like different changes that are going to happen as the company grows and breaks into new markets. And you know, like as regulations continue piling up, because it seems like there's a lot of regulations as well. That kind of make each individual deal very complex. Like, one thing that Zach mentioned was the change management that needs to take place with each customer. \nTy Phillippay:\nAnd making sure that it actually happened, because some people, like Bob's Trucking, are willing to kind of just show up and sign up. And you're like, dude, are you sure? Like, you at least know what this is, right? Like, I've literally had to slow people down for my own comfortability. And then, if we add in what is highly likely, some sort of tax credit scenario that gets decided on and passed next year to incentivize employers to add. ICHRAS. I mean, go to market will turn into everything else. We're just gonna be answering phones and trying to enroll people. I mean, that's- we will all just be answering phones and enrolling people because it will go ballistic. I mean, less than 1% of Americans are covered under an ICRA today, and it'll likely be 40% in five years. So it's going to be nuts. \nRachel Antone:\nYeah. Well, great news for that. \nTy Phillippay:\nYeah. \nRachel Antone:\nIf that's going to be the future, if people are so unhappy with the way that these traditional insurance companies are operating, which... Yeah, just the meetings that I attended alone over the past few months. I was like, this is this. There's got to be a better way. And then, like I said, heard about Andrew and just was like, OK, love, love that. This is modernizing that side. That is actually such a headache. So difficult for so many people. And like, you need, you need health care. So, yeah, absolutely. I know we only have one minute left. I just have one question. \nTy Phillippay:\nPlease, please. Okay. \nRachel Antone:\nOkay, awesome. So last question is a bit more around, like, what the like, what the perfect scenario for enablement would be, would love to hear what's one thing you are actually? sorry, that's not the question. Based on your experience and benefits and HRS partnerships, what would you prioritize first if you were building enablement from scratch here? Or, like, obviously, you wouldn't be doing that, but like, encouraging. Enablement to build from scratch. \nTy Phillippay:\nI think you're thinking about this is a good question. Um, I come from more of an old school sales training approach. If somebody wanted to be a broker, they had to come to our training and our training was functional. We didn't like it wasn't just get together and then we all get a certificate like we would go through. Here's how it's changing. These are the new state regs. This is the form you have to use, right? It was like, legit, and then if you didn't go to the training, you didn't get appointed because you didn't know what was going on. Um, and so I think if we were to have the guts to find a way to be the technology leaders. But have maintain a value, a real value around. Like, Yeah, but if you want to party with us. This is what it looks like. And right now, we're just taking everything that comes our way. And that's how you do it when you're growing. But we're into a now where we will have the opportunity to dictate terms on partnership agreements or how brokers are going to operate with us, right? So I think the biggest thing I would have is pick one system. One. Place. Even if it's super inefficient, I don't care if it's Excel. That is like the Alamo. Yeah, because everybody knows something and nobody knows everything here, yeah. And we try and use Slack, and that's conducive to some work styles and not others. Um, I would argue it's not conducive long term to building culture or strategy. It's just more of a. We're just going to keep trying to hit the mice with with a bag of rocks instead of like, where are these mice coming from? and why are they in here? Like, you know what, I mean, reaction, reaction, reaction, lost, it's all it goes. So I think for the most successful path forward is you don't have to pick the right system, you don't even have to pick the right materials. You know, it can all be slightly wrong, but what has to be right is this? Well, when the chips are down, this is where the information will be. And no, you can't keep it on the Slack channel. It has to be here and somebody's going to have to kind of have their elbows out at some point. Well, I guess you welcome everybody to kind of share the pertinent and re, you know, but at some point, you got to be like that. You just can't tell half the team in a random Thursday meeting, something like that. That's not how we roll. You have to actually come to us, and we'll make the process as blissfully positive as possible. But kind of like marketing, you know, marketing can be involved in stuff, but they also can not be involved in stuff. And that's where you start to get into trouble is people using, you know. Quasi-marketing looking stuff that doesn't have proper disclaimers, that doesn't. That's the stuff that makes me a little nervous around here. In the run and gun modality that we enjoy right now. I'm just kind of like, we should have more structure to this. So really just starting that structure somewhere, getting buy off from the team leadership and then incentivizing participation versus mandating it. You know, make it, make it, so, even if it's simple at first, it's so simple and so effective. They at least got to use that one, you know? So I think you'll be much more attuned to this than I am. But like we have notion, we have. I mean, I could tell you 22 different systems that I have access to that I really don't understand what. What does it do specifically best, and will it communicate with the rest of the stuff? You know, it's all just sort of like, people are like, oh, I keep all my stuff here. I'm like, I don't even go to that system. \nRachel Antone:\nYeah. \nTy Phillippay:\nYou know, and so it's like solutioning for that. Like, what is everybody doing? Like, we can at least all agree that it's this, right? You know, and then building up on your way. The entire time, you'll be peppered with questions from people like, well, we're on the platforms team, so we can't use your material. And here's why. Okay, then we have to have a platforms. Version of the same material, you know? Like, so you're always flexing and bartering and stuff, but you're centering it. That's going to be what everybody wants. Um, but it's hard in my experience to just nail that, right. It's a process. Yeah, yeah, I think simplicity and direction and centralization is just where it's got to go. And then, using your skills that you've talked about, I think you really get a lot of the help that you would need. Pretty routinely from people who are just like, sure, I'll give it to you, or here it is. But, man, that is exhausting. You know, that's carrying all the buckets of water to the well. That's a different thing, right? It's like, it's going to take forever, but it's kind of what somebody's got to do. Or, you know, if you can, effectively, kind of, I think this team would respond super well to. Tell me your secret selling power. Or, you know, people want to share what they've learned and achieved. It's they maybe don't want to share it in front of everybody. But maybe you could, you know. Like, drive all that data and in tools and stuff. And then you start to, oh, look, 30 of people roughly are using this demo, and why do we have two demos? Well, you know, like, just starting to eliminate stuff. You'd love it, you'd love it, and it's it's, uh, I guess it's almost like I like to go to garage sales, right? So some garage sales are better than others. It's just that's just a general rule. It's almost like the person who will come in if they love it, if they love sales enablement, they will be walking into this place. It's like a perfect environment for their skill set. They are the magnet that was sorely missing. It'll work, you know, people will respond and stuff, um, we're just going to make. There'll be some easy improvements, like you said, that you could just kind of like, let's start with those, you know, like, get our name out there. There'll be some hard stuff, though, too, on the back end. And we're going to have a ton of channel conflict because we're working with brokers. We're working with payroll companies. That's going to get real. And it's going to be something that even at, you know, audience like managing the audiences, that the resource of that you get to. That'll be a bit of a challenge. \nRachel Antone:\nYeah. \nTy Phillippay:\nI think that's what an effective person would be able to come into and and effect change, you know, yeah, that's so helpful. \nRachel Antone:\nI think, I mean, like. It's especially like during this interview process, seeing that even founders and the chief revenue officer and CEO are involved in the process. I know there's going to be a lot of competing opinions, but to be honest, I think that's, that's something I really, really enjoy. I get, or I love getting to have a seat at the table. Because I've always kind of had to figure out how can I get into that conversation? Or, like, Yeah. You know, like, bring these two parties together. So I think already having that, like seeing that in the process, is a huge win. Um, but yes, lots of emotions. Also figuring things out. Um, I know that, you know, reps, love that you mentioned the channel side of things I talked to Chad on Friday, um, and that's, that's kind of his wheelhouse. Um, so yeah, excited to hear about those obstacles. But I know, know, there's a lot of emotions and frustration. when, you know, they're our complications. And you know, like, like, different, um, obstacles. And and so, um, I mean, this is sales. A lot of strong personalities, but I think that that's what makes it fun and and those are I. I really love. Like, getting to, like, prove to different teams. You said that this wasn't going to work. I'm going to show that we will either find a different way or try something different. I love experimenting and just figuring out, okay, how do we hit the market in a way that will work? or, you know, maybe reorder some things or what have you. But then like the bringing, bringing everyone to the water, I like, that's like, like, day to day, very, very, very familiar with that sort of thing. But excited about, like, the conversations, you know, the the pushback, getting to work through these challenges. And help the team feel a lot more confident. As opposed to just feeling like, you know, we're frustrated, we're banging our head into a wall, you know, with whatever situation we're running into. Yeah. \nTy Phillippay:\nAwesome. All right. Well, I appreciate the opportunity to meet with you. This was a great conversation. I think next steps, they'll handle the follow-up with you, But you'll get high marks from me and my, you know, feedback to the group. And then they'll be following up with you on timeline and all that. But we are definitely at the end of our long kind of run here. Well, actually, it goes past Christmas here we're gonna so really at the end of December, um, is when our big group enrollment stuff ends, and so, um, hopefully, though, I know this is a top priority. Higher. So if for some reason, you're, you're not getting feedback or anything. Feel free to reach out to me and I'll answer any question I can or help you any way I can. \nRachel Antone:\nWell, thank you so much, Ty. Really appreciate all that you shared. This conversation was so much fun and just like, loved getting to learn your perspective on all of this. So, but yes, we'll definitely keep in touch, and yeah, I hope you have a great Christmas as well. Literally next week. \nTy Phillippay:\nHoly Toledo. Yeah, it's coming. \nRachel Antone:\nYeah. And then New Year's, and then just, yeah. So. \nTy Phillippay:\nYeah. Absolutely okay. Well, thank you. have a have a great one yourself you too. \nRachel Antone:\nThanks ty bye. \n",

The company recently received a 42% renewal increase from Aetna/AFA. The current monthly employer cost is approximately $10,357 based on renewal numbers.\n\nThe workforce consists primarily of hourly employees (with only 5-6 salaried employees) and experiences high turnover due to the seasonal nature of the business. Most enrolled employees are above 45 years of age. The company is located in New Jersey (Belvedere and Morristown area) and is structured as an LLC partnership.

                "value": "Account Notes: Infinite Therapy Solutions - ICHRA Exploration and Implementation\n\n1. Key Points Discussed\n\n- Employer's Interest in ICHRA: The primary driver for exploring ICHRA is to manage significant 2026 renewal costs, with the current group plan facing a 42% increase. The employer aims to reduce healthcare costs and administrative workload, particularly due to the challenges of managing a seasonal workforce with high turnover.\n\n- Current Situation: The company currently offers a traditional group health insurance plan (Aetna POS 3000) with a 65% employer contribution. The workforce includes 73 employees, with only 13 currently enrolled in health benefits. The company faces administrative challenges due to frequent hiring and turnover.\n\n- ICHRA Solution Proposed: ICHRA allows employees to receive a pre-tax allowance to purchase individual plans. Two allowance models were discussed: a flat rate for all employees or a variable rate based on demographics. Thatch handles all administration, including premium payments, enrollments, and compliance.\n\n- Compliance and Cost Challenges: Key compliance issues include class carve-out restrictions and partnership owner eligibility. The ICHRA solution was found to be more expensive than the current renewal, with geographic coverage limitations and age demographics impacting costs.\n\n2. Stakeholders Involved\n\n- Infinite Therapy Solutions (Prospect/Customer):\n  - Poonam: Co-owner, financial decision-maker, and benefits administrator.\n  - Hillary Fryczynski: Co-owner, responsible for employee communication and operational oversight.\n\n- Thatch (Vendor):\n  - Caroline Clark: ICHRA solution specialist and primary point of contact for implementation.\n  - Molly Marshall: Channel Partnerships team, supporting broker relationships.\n\n- Liberty (Broker):\n  - Samantha Winter: Primary broker, coordinating ICHRA exploration and compliance guidance.\n  - LeighAnn Panas: Supporting broker, providing compliance guidance and carrier relationship management.\n\n3. Important Milestones and Timestamps\n\n- December 04, 2025: Initial discovery call and product demonstration.\n- December 05, 2025: Follow-up meeting to review cost analysis and contribution recommendations.\n- December 08, 2025: Decision made to proceed with ICHRA; selected 50% contribution at 50th percentile Silver benchmark.\n- December 15, 2025: Critical deadline for employee plan selections to ensure January 1, 2026, coverage effective date.\n- December 16, 2025: ICHRA exploration meeting, identifying compliance and cost challenges.\n\n4. Next Steps with Deadlines and Responsible Parties\n\n- Immediate Actions:\n  - Quote Review and Analysis: Melissa, Steve Vande Vrede, Samantha Winter, and LeighAnn Panas to review Thatch quote link by December 23, 2025.\n  - Owner Coverage Solution Research: Samantha Winter to provide resource link for independent marketplace enrollment by December 20, 2025.\n  - Internal Stakeholder Discussion: Melissa and Steve Vande Vrede to discuss ICHRA findings with Michael Vande Vrede by December 23, 2025.\n\n- Strategic Decisions Needed:\n  - Renewal Strategy Determination: Ownership team to decide on renewal strategy before Aetna renewal effective date.\n  - Alternative Carrier Exploration: Samantha Winter and LeighAnn Panas to pursue quotes"

The brokers play a crucial role in coordinating meetings with vendors and assisting with plan selection and renewals.

She just needed to wrap up a call. \nIsra Ahmed:\nOkay. \nMelissa:\nYeah, Steve says he's getting on now. He just texted me back. \nSamantha.Winter:\nOkay, perfect. And Melissa, So we talked about doing a thatch slice for your hourly people, which I know Caroline confirmed we could do through thatch. We did take the question over to our rep at our general agent who works with Aetna, just to make sure there wouldn't be an issue. Aetna would have an issue, so we wouldn't be able to do Thatch and Aetna, but we do have this as an option. Okay. \nMelissa:\nSo we just found that out. So we completely thatch them? Correct. Okay. \nSamantha.Winter:\nSo we can't do both. \nMelissa:\nYeah, that is probably going to cause an issue, but let's just go through it anyway and see what it is. Exactly. \nSamantha.Winter:\nThis way, we can make sure that you have an understanding of what that is, how it works, if you decide to move this route. Okay? \nMelissa:\nOkay. Okay. Steve, are you on? \nSteve Vande Vrede:\nI'm here. \nIsra Ahmed:\nHi, Steve. Okay. Hello. \nMelissa:\nHow are you guys? \nIsra Ahmed:\nDoing great. Nice to meet you. \nSteve Vande Vrede:\nYou too. \nIsra Ahmed:\nAll right. Well, I'm Isra. I'm on the business team here at Taj. You know, I got some information. Samantha sent me some information about you guys prior to the call. But yeah, I would love to just hear from you guys as well. You know, what is prompting the surge? What are you hoping for when you look at other vendors for health benefits? And yeah, anything that you would want to add? \nSamantha.Winter:\nSo, Isra, the reason why we were trying to... Look at this as an option. Is AETNa? AFA hit them with a 42% increase. So trying to see what we can do to help bring that. \nIsra Ahmed:\nDown, Okay, and um, it seems like there are 73 total employees, but only 13 are enrolled. Why is there such a low enrollment right now? \nMelissa:\nMost of our employees do not want to, um, to enroll in it. Um, we have a very unique workforce here, we don't want seasonal employees. \nIsra Ahmed:\nOkay, Okay. So, out of the 73, like, who are the, how many are true full-time employees? I'm sorry? How many full-time? \nMelissa:\nOh, that's, wait, let me just pull that up. I don't have it. I believe right now we're at 61. \nIsra Ahmed:\n61 full-time? Yeah, I believe so. Okay. And then you said there are some hourly and salaried employees. \nMelissa:\nThere are some salaries. \nSamantha.Winter:\nIt's heavier on the hourly employees as opposed to salary. Yeah, there's about five or six of us that are salary. Six of us, I believe. Okay. \nIsra Ahmed:\nAnd so out of the 13 enrolled, there are some, like hourly and salaried people enrolled in this, right? \nMelissa:\nYes. \nIsra Ahmed:\nOkay. And then I see everyone is on that same like POS 3000 deductible plan. And then you guys are covering about 90% across all the tiers. We do. Wait, you mean our... \nMelissa:\nWhat is 90%? \nIsra Ahmed:\nYou covered 90% of the premium for all of the employees, correct? No, no, we do 65%. Okay, that's what I had on the census. So let me just, So it's 65% across all tiers? \nMelissa:\nThat's what we cover, yeah. That's our piece of it. \nIsra Ahmed:\nOkay. \nMelissa:\nI don't know where that 90 came from. \nSamantha.Winter:\nYeah, I'm... Looking, I'm trying to pull up the census I sent over now. \nIsra Ahmed:\nAwesome. So essentially what we cover at that. I can kind of chat about that. And then we can dive deeper into the specifics of how it can work for your company. So can you guys see my screen, okay? \nSamantha.Winter:\nYes. \nMelissa:\nI'm having a tough time hearing you, and somehow I also just lost my Zoom. There it is. Okay. Okay. \nIsra Ahmed:\nIs your volume turned up all the way? \nMelissa:\nYeah, my volume is, I'm actually called in on my phone, so there's a little bit of a delay, But it's also that I'm a little bit, my hearing is not that great. So, um, okay. \nIsra Ahmed:\nI can try to speak louder. Let me know if you need me to repeat anything. I can also repeat anything and double click into anything. But are you able to see my screen, okay? Okay. Okay. Can you see my screen? Yeah. Okay, perfect. Awesome. So here at Thatch, our mission is to build a healthcare system that people love. And the way that we do that is by implementing the ICRA. So what the Icra stands for is called individual coverage HRA. It comes under the umbrella of HRAS. And it essentially allows you as employer to issue your employees a pre-tax health care stipend. That each of them can use to buy their own individual plans, which are all listed within our platform. So they're individual, medical, dental, vision. So, essentially, you are deciding what the costs are. You're going to decide what your costs are, what is the allowances that you're giving each of your employees. And then your employees use that allowance to pick a plan that meets their needs. So each of your employees are going to see local plans to them. So they'll pick a plan based on their own needs. No, two employees have to pick the same plan. And there are usually multiple different carriers, multiple different plan options. And then with this, with the funds, once employees use that, they can use it on their medical premium. They can use the leftover funds if they have any, and if you allow it, on things like co-pays, prescriptions, kind of like an FSA. So they can use it on other qualified medical expenses as well. So over here, this person got $750. She picked a plan that was $500. The remaining $250 works like an FSA, and it goes on to attach debit card. That they can use physically or virtually. Another place that they can use their leftover funds on is the Tatch Marketplace. So the Tatch marketplace gives your employees access to a bunch of health and wellness services that we partner with. So things like fertility benefits, sleep, mental health, you know, any tests, any equipment, whatever that may be, They can use their funds directly on the Tatch marketplace to get that as well. Okay. Any questions that are coming up here on the quick overview? \nMelissa:\nNot yet. I'm just kind of gathering the understanding of it. Yeah. \nIsra Ahmed:\nSo this model... \nMelissa:\nThe biggest problem... Go ahead. You can keep going, and then I'll ask questions at the end. No, no. \nIsra Ahmed:\nYou can ask a question as we go. \nMelissa:\nYeah, unfortunately. So the reason I'm saying that is you might actually answer my questions before I, you know what I mean, as you're going through it, you might already answer my questions, Because basically, my biggest concern is how it would be handled to. We have a large turnover of employees because our work is very seasonal. And so getting someone on, then getting them off again, figuring out how much is left on this healthcare budget. It, it might become a concern for us. We don't have like our employees. That we turn over aren't considered seasonal or temporary because of the length of time that they work, but they don't stay year round, and we don't necessarily hire them back every single year. Sometimes it's a whole different batch of people and older ones interspersed. So that's where we're basically a small business, with a lot of people all of a sudden. You know what I mean? \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah. So those employees that are turning over, are they utilizing the health benefit? \nMelissa:\nRight now, they don't usually sign up for it. You know, right now, nobody has really been that interested in having it. I think because they probably feel it's as much of a hassle to get on and get off again, you know, and then they're dealing with cobra or not being on COBRA. You know, it's just like the keeping up piece of it. You know, at this point, we just get a sign form, they don't want it, and then we're done, you know? \nIsra Ahmed:\nyeah. \nMelissa:\nBut like I said, go ahead and explain the whole program, and then we can, we can go through, like, the, those types of questions, because that's really my biggest concern, is how it gets handled. \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah, no, for sure, and thanks for bringing that up, and I will get to, like, how that is handled. But yeah, so, essentially, with this model, the plans are priced solely based on where employees live, how old they are, and the number of their dependents. So employees are seeing plans and prices local to them, and prices based on their demographics. So each of our employees are going to see different plans and prices. So now, because the plans prices, they vary based on each person's demographic, there are two ways that you could do allowances. So one, you could either give everyone the same flat allowance across the board, you can say everyone gets $900, like in this example. But if you were to give everyone the same allowance across the board, you know, younger people would be able to do a lot more with that than older people, people in, you know, cheaper states, let's say, would be able to do a lot more with that than people are more expensive states. So this would create unequal purchasing powers. However, you're still allowed to do that. But then another way to do allowances is to give different allowances to each person towards a certain level plan. And we typically start with the current plan that you're on. We try to map that to a similar level. Plan on patch and say, hey, how much would you have to offer each person to give them this level of coverage? Now, the level of coverage, you can decide what that benchmark is. The whole beauty of the Icra is that you can decide where the, you know, where this lies. Does that make sense? \nMelissa:\nYeah. Yeah, that makes sense. All right. \nIsra Ahmed:\nSo, yeah. So the contributions are up to you, and there are two ways that you can do that. And then Tatch. Tatch is the only end-to-end Icra third-party administrator in the space. So we automate everything from premium payments, enrollments, compliance, payroll deductions, and so forth. So the only thing that you guys have to do as the employers are, um, are. You know, decide those allowances, which we help you do, and the only thing your employees have to do are pick their plans. Everything else is handled by us. So, you know, we'll take a look at like, when the compliance documents are ready and all of that. When payroll deductions are needed to happen, we'll do all of that there. Okay, and then this slide is kind of just comparing group plans to ICRA. So, you know, with the current coverage that you're offering today, you have to decide on the plan for your team. Everyone is on that same plan, regardless of their needs, regardless of their, you know, their doctors being in network or not. And then you're kind of left dealing with renewals and these increasing costs. With group plans, the costs also increase 15 to 35 percent year over year. Whereas with the Icarus, the... Plans, prices, they kind of stay at a plateau because there are so many different options. Some might increase, some might decrease, but they still don't increase the way that group plans do. And then the other thing is, with this model, you don't have to pick a plan for your team. Each of your employees picks a plan based on their needs, your setting and budget, based on your appetite. And so you get to control costs while offering flexibility and choice to your team. And then this slide kind of walks through, like how, you know, with when you're offering a group plan, you're offering one plan, you have to pick. Like the most expensive, national level kind of PPO plan that encompasses everyone's needs. And then when you move to the Icra model, you move to multiple different carriers, multiple different plans, And a lot of employees end up picking plans that meet their needs, but are not the most expensive PPOs. You know, they might pick cheaper plans. All right. Any other questions? \nMelissa:\nNo, I mean, it seems pretty straightforward. So they would then enroll in, like your website, to figure out what plan they would be going to, or they would just go to, like the state that they're in? Yeah, no. \nIsra Ahmed:\nSo they would go to our, the plans are all listed within TAC, so they don't have to go to any other like government website or anything. They just do it within TAC. And, and then, yeah, their plans, and, and then that's it. So, to answer your question about the seasonal employees now, when your employees enroll in plans and then let's say they are leaving mid year, all you have to do is just off board them within touch. Once they're off boarded, then, you know, they're good to go. And then, yeah, and then if they join again next year, though, you can adjust that next year. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nSo when you say off-boarding, they can continue their plan direct with the carrier. They're just not part of the group's Icra anymore. Exactly. \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah. So because these are individual plans, they're tied to the individual. So they still have the plan. They're just going to stop receiving the funding towards it. Okay. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nI'm sorry, Melissa, I cut you off, too. What was your question? You actually just asked the question that I was going to, so that's perfect. Our minds work alike. \nSamantha.Winter:\nYeah. \nMelissa:\nSo now the other question I have, though, is what happens if someone decides not to enroll? Are we still liable for setting up this HRA card for them? Or if they just say, no, they don't want to do it at all, we just don't get involved with them and nothing goes into their account? \nIsra Ahmed:\nNo. So you just send invites to everyone. If people don't want to enroll in this, they can just ignore that invite. They don't have to do anything, and you don't have to do anything. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nThey don't get anything. Yeah. \nIsra Ahmed:\nYou're only funding the people that are enrolling in a plan. Okay. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nAnd I think we clarified before, Sam, just to touch on, and you guys might have touched on this before I joined. I apologize. I was late. But, um, from a Thatch perspective, the seasonal employee, like, we can carve out where Thatch is okay with a certain class of employees being here with thatch. And then let's say salaried employees are on a group plan that stays in existence and that works in the thatch system model for an ICRA? \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah, you can have hourly employees on the ICRa and salaried employees on a group plan, yeah. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nOkay. For Steve and Melissa, Aetna has a slightly different take on it. And we didn't ask about you guys specifically. And we technically are through the renewal, so to speak. So we're not filling out certification paperwork right now. But they still require 20% participation. So we potentially could run into an issue next year with them filling out to make that we're eligible. That they would find fault with having our group split like this. However, they took the group to begin with. And they've seen the whole census and know that we, you know, we're already, there's already a load for participation. So I don't think it's the end of the world, But it could be something, an issue that we run into with next year's renewal, going through certification. Yeah. \nIsra Ahmed:\nAnd one thing I'll call out about the ICRA, like when you do create that class, there needs to be at least 10 people on the Icra as well. So there is... If when you create a class, there is a minimum participation requirement. If there are no classes, then there isn't a minimum participation. But if you're creating a class, then there needs to be at least 10 hourly people that are enrolling in the graph. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nEnrolling, not even just offered, actually enrolling. Okay. \nSamantha.Winter:\nThat's news to us. That wasn't shared before. \nMelissa:\nWhat happens if we don't have 10 people that want to enroll in it? What if we have nine? There's nothing like Wacky like that. Does it just not get offered at all at that point? \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah, it would not, like, it wouldn't be compliant. Then you would face some compliance issues. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nSo that's not a, that is like, an icra rule, not necessarily a thatch rule? \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah, that's an icra rule. Okay. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nOkay. And that's only a carve-out, whereas if the whole group moved over, it's, yeah, okay. \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah, that's only if you're doing the full-time, part-time carve-out with the group plan. So that... Minimum participation comes into play. If you're also offering your group alongside an ICRA, then there needs to be at least 10 people on the ICRA. Okay. Okay. \nMelissa:\nNow, another quick question is there's a minimum wage type requirement for making the insurance affordable. Does this bypass that completely with the allowance for the HRA, or is this something we still have to take into consideration. \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah, so you do have to offer minimum affordable coverage, even with the ICRA. It is different than how it's done on group. It has its own affordability requirements and we check for that when we're setting those allowances. And I have created a quote for you with the 12 enrolled employees so we can walk through that. But yeah. Are there any other questions, or should I kind of talk through the quote? \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nI think we can talk through the quote. Yeah. \nIsra Ahmed:\nAll right. So this is what the quote looks like here. So, all right. Just to confirm one thing, the lowest salary across your group is. 23,400. \nSamantha.Winter:\nMelissa, Just so, you know, when I, I took the census that you had provided with everyone's hourly, and then I took that and multiplied it by 25 hours a week and 52 weeks a year. Just to give a minimum, minimum number. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nSo it could be higher than that. \nSamantha.Winter:\nIt could be higher than this. \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah, but we. That's fair, so that is, that's actually going to determine the quote and like, determine affordability piece. \nSamantha.Winter:\nSo what? \nIsra Ahmed:\nWhat is the lowest salary across all of your full-time employees? \nMelissa:\nThe lowest is 15 an hour, so that's our, that's our, um, like, our lowest hourly pay is we start everybody at 15 an hour. Okay, so that's 31, 200, that's our, that's our, like, lowest level employer. You know, we have a bunch of laborers here that... Basically where they're at and it goes up from there. \nIsra Ahmed:\nOkay, so that's different than what I have, so let me just update that. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nI was going to say, Can you adjust that on the fly? \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah, just give me one second. \nMelissa:\nAnd also, just so, you know, Steve lost his connection, so I don't know if he's going to try to get back on or if he's just going to politely exit here. I'm not sure what's going on with his computer downstairs. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nThat's okay. All right. \nIsra Ahmed:\nSuggesting this. Alright, give me one second. I'm just adjusting something there. Sure, take your time. Alright. So this is what the quote looks like here. So what you're seeing on this side is the benchmark. So, you know, I mentioned the plans, prices, they vary based on each person's ZiP code, age, and dependent count. So each of your employees are going to different prices for their plans. And so we use a benchmark level plan to ensure that everyone is getting coverage towards similar level plan. And so these? What you can decide here is like, okay, a bronze level plan, silver, gold. And then these numbers are that specific. The first percentile is the cheapest bronze, silver, or gold plan. The 100th percentile is the most expensive bronze, silver, or gold plan. Now, for you guys, I mapped the current plan that you guys are on today, the POS 3000. And that came to a 50th percentile silver. And we can talk more about what plan it maps to. We try to match it as close as possible. Obviously, individual plans are going to be different than group plans. There may not be an exact match, but we try to match it as close as possible in the plan design. And then I've applied the 65% cost sharing across the board here. I had to increase the employer contribution to 67% for the employees. Because as you see, once I go to 65%, it tells me that. Two employees are receiving an unaffordable allowance. So we just have to adjust. To ensure that everyone is coming out affordable with this. \nMelissa:\nSo the other thing that two employees that just showed up there, if you go back to that 65% where it says two employees, those two employees are drivers. And while they make hourly wages, they also get paid flat, and they had no way of putting in those flats. So certain runs that they do, so we have tractor trailers and certain runs we do, we pay them a flat rate of, you know, X amount of dollars, you know, a day for this run. So we don't, I did not actually in this whole calculation with the hours, calculate those two in. So I don't think that they would be outside of that because I think their flat rates would actually bring those two particular people up. Increase them. \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah, but we take, we take the lowest salary, and we use that as affordability. To take a more conservative approach, because if you hire someone that is a similar age as these people. But with that salary, we just want to ensure they're also being covered. So we just take the lowest salary across the board. Which you told me was 15 an hour. So then I just multiplied that by 2080 and then that gave me 31,200 as your minimum salary. Okay, so that's what we're basing the affordability off of. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nAnd that's in an effort to guarantee it's affordable and not look, you're not, because you can't look at this every month, at every individual person. Is that? \nIsra Ahmed:\nExactly. Yeah. So it's to guarantee that if you hire someone else that, you know, is maybe could be more, could be older than these people, that they're also getting an affordable allowance. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nOkay. \nIsra Ahmed:\nSo yeah, and then over here in the middle, you're seeing that different. Each of your employees are getting a different allowance based on their demographics. So, like Ronald, for example, is 54 with zero dependents would get 688. But then James, who's 57, is getting 785. So, accounting for that little bit of an age difference. Most of your employees are kind of like in the above 45 range. And then, yeah, and then the people with dependents will get some more there and so forth. Now, over here, it shows that your current spend is $10,357 on health benefits. Is that correct? You said you offer something on the side as well. Is this accurate? Does this sound accurate to what you guys would be spending? Not today, sorry. It's close. \nMelissa:\nMonthly, it's, oh, I'm talking about the total. Okay. Wait one second. Let me just. \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah, I'm sorry. These are renewal numbers. So what you would be paying if you were to renew with your current group plan, it would be $10,350. \nMelissa:\nYeah, let me just. Oh, I see. Okay. Your cost. \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah. So, the employer portion. \nMelissa:\nYeah, it's probably close enough. Yeah. \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah. So that's what the, like, your renewal is coming at. And you know, when I ran this benchmark at what, what we think would be one affordable, but also similar, it is coming a little higher than your renewal. So that's one thing to note there. Okay. I'm not seeing cost savings right off the bat here. Yeah. No. \nMelissa:\nAnd just to be, just to be clear, the coverage that we're talking about in that is only for the state that the person is in. Like, it's not nationwide. is there anything that's nationwide? \nIsra Ahmed:\nOh, okay, no, so that depends. So, for example, in Pennsylvania there are PPO plans, so PPO plans are nationwide plans. So people in Pennsylvania have 38 options to pick. Like nationwide plans, essentially, but people in New Jersey only have EPO options, and these do not provide network coverage. So that's, yeah, another call out there. Okay. \nMelissa:\nYeah. So it's not exactly the same at that point because we're losing the, unfortunately, every one of my doctors is in Pennsylvania and I live in New Jersey. That's like a direct concern for me, but we can work. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nI mean, and just New Jersey is small, and we have access to, like, direct access to Philadelphia and New York. So it's always, it stinks that the individual New Jersey market only has EPOS, because then anyone in the individual market is stuck. Essentially not being able to seek care in, like, two of the largest markets. Like, if something happened to you and you needed care, chances are you're going to go to New York to see a specialist versus New Jersey. \nMelissa:\nExactly, Yeah, no, I totally understand. \nIsra Ahmed:\nSo, yeah, um, you know, for your group personally, like, I don't think this is that compelling, given there aren't that much cost savings and there are only EPO options. Um, So, yeah, I can send this to you if you guys want to take a look, But I think staying probably on that group option might be better. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nSo this is, so when we're looking at the rates, it's actually 42, our renewal is 42%. So these individual rates are just right up there with that renewal, basically, is what you're saying. Yeah. Yeah. \nIsra Ahmed:\nSo in some states, the individual rates, you know, might not be as competitive. It seems like in New Jersey, it's not as competitive. But then the other states, they perform really, really well. And it also just depends on, like the type of group plan you have, other factors as well. This is also because these plans are age-banded, like, typically, when there's a group that has mostly people above 45, it can tend to be more expensive. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nYeah. Okay. \nSamantha.Winter:\nOkay. Yeah, if you don't mind sharing that with me, the, you know, you're... \nIsra Ahmed:\nYour quote? That would be awesome because then I can go over it with my supervisor since he kind of cut out on us. \nMelissa:\nYeah, I don't know what's going on down there with his connection, but apparently he was not able to get back on. \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah, for sure. Yeah, I'll send it to you guys, and then you'll also be able to, um, when you send it. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nIt's a. Is it a link to the proposal? From what I recall? And then we can kind of play around with it. \nIsra Ahmed:\nOr, okay, Yeah, so you'll get a link to this. It'll come here, and then you can click on edit, And then you can also play around with these and click into any employee as well, view the plans and breakdown, and all of that. Another thing I want to ask, like, how is the company taxed? What do you mean? \nMelissa:\nAs a C-corp or is Steve, are they s-corp owners? Oh, we're an LLC. Mike and Steve, it's an LLC partnership. \nIsra Ahmed:\nOh, a partnership. And then, who are the owners of the partnership? \nMelissa:\nMichael Vandevried and Stephen VandeVried. Okay, yeah. \nIsra Ahmed:\nSo partnership owners are also not eligible for the ICRA, so they wouldn't be able to use Tadge. They would just have to go to the marketplace to pick their plans up, as opposed to picking their plans on Tadge. So that's another thing to keep in mind. Okay. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nOkay. \nMelissa:\nSo if they were to go, so if we were to, let me just clarify that. If we were to go entirely, our entire group. That they would have to go independently and get their own insurance as like a two person group somewhere else. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nWe would assist them and they would be buying individual coverage, But it just couldn't be in the shell of the Icra because of how they're taxed, because they're the owners. \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah, yeah. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nThey're accessing the same plans. It's not as easy because it's not through this system. \nMelissa:\nDoes that generally tend to make their rates more expensive? Expensive at that point? \nIsra Ahmed:\nNo, individual plans are rated, all rated on the same way. So they're all rated based on ZIP code, age, independent count. Okay. Yeah. So the plans and prices are the same. They're just can't pick it on the patch platform. Because we show the off exchange versions of those plans, which these off exchange plans are eligible for, that pre-tax deduction and partnership owners receive. A pre-tax, uh, pre-tax benefits from the government already, so the I.R.S sees that as double dipping into pre-tax benefits. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nOkay, gotcha, can you just go back real quick? For me? I mean, I'm gonna see it on my own. But that summary where it says that the thatch price, the, Yeah, the $20,534. \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah, I would focus more on the total employer cost. The total healthcare spend, that varies. That depends on, like, what plans employees pick, right? So the employees portion depends on the plan they pick from all of the like 50 something options they have. So I wouldn't focus too much on the total healthcare spend. I would just look at the total employer cost. Okay. And this total employer cost is, yeah, also assuming that all employees are going to, like, max out their allowance. Like, for example, Daniel. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nFor the total current cost, like, where do you have that loaded? If we wanted to see to make sure, like. \nIsra Ahmed:\nIt's right here, the one that says currently. So this is, I took the renewal numbers as the current. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nOkay. \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah. \nMelissa:\nAnd how many total employees are? is it just the 12 that are showing? there is there, so this basis is just the 12 enrolled? \nIsra Ahmed:\nyeah, the 12 enrolled employees. Yeah, okay. And then Leanne, I don't have your email, but I can send this to you as well if you share your email with me. If you could drop it in the chat, um, I will drop that in the chat. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nOkay, I can't spell my name today. \nSamantha.Winter:\nThat's not good, Leigh. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nYeah, this was helpful. I look forward to seeing just the link. So we can take a look closer at this and compare it to the renewal to see if it's viable. At the outset, it doesn't seem. Because of the New Jersey access, I wish everybody was in Pennsylvania, but we can talk more about it. Yeah. \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah, Pennsylvania is pretty good on here. But, yeah, I'll send this. I've sent this to all of you guys. So just feel free to reach out if you have any questions. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nOkay. Okay. \nSamantha.Winter:\nPerfect. \nMelissa:\nThank you. Okay. Great. Thank you very much. \nIsra Ahmed:\nThank you. \nSamantha.Winter:\nIsra, can you stay on for just a minute? Yeah, sure. \nIsra Ahmed:\nOkay. \nSamantha.Winter:\nOkay. Melissa, I just had to ask her a question about a different group. Okay, sure. No problem. \nMelissa:\nAll right. Thank you so much. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nI have to jump for another call too, but we'll connect Sam. \nSamantha.Winter:\nOkay. So Israel, um, so, so. Caroline was messaging me about, um, another group, you know, in the two to 50 segment, um, the owners, it's the same thing. They're an LLP. So they can't enroll in the Thatch platform. I asked her to get me the name of someone who could assist her, and she never did. Do you have anyone? She said that there were thatch brokers. \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah, that can assist. That can assist. \nSamantha.Winter:\nYes. \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah. Yeah, for sure. Here, let me. \nSamantha.Winter:\nThank you. Just because the owner followed up with me a little while ago, asking for the name of someone. So I know. Yeah. \nIsra Ahmed:\nSo they're already enrolled on Thatch? \nSamantha.Winter:\nThey're not already. The group is in Thatch. The owners, when we met with Caroline, Caroline didn't ask how the group was taxed. So we didn't know any of that until after everyone else was put on and had their invite sent. Okay. Yeah. Sorry about that. \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah. So I just dropped the link in the chat. So this is what owners can use to... Um... To enroll, I mean, to get some help, to enroll in like a plan. Yeah. \nSamantha.Winter:\nPerfect. Thank you so much. I appreciate that. \nIsra Ahmed:\nOf course. Yeah, no worries. Yeah. Well, hope you have a good day. I'm sorry we couldn't help out much with this group. Some groups they perform well, some groups they don't. This one, there wasn't a ton of cost savings here, But I'm looking forward to working with you in the future on any other opportunities, hopefully with better cost savings. But yeah, feel free to reach out to me. And I've sent the quote over to you as well, but let me know if any questions come up. \nSamantha.Winter:\nOkay, perfect. Thank you again so much, Isra. I appreciate it. Of course. \nIsra Ahmed:\nHave a good day. \nSamantha.Winter:\nOkay, you too. Bye. \n",

KEY POINTS DISCUSSED\n\nEmployer's Interest in ICHRA\n- Current Situation: Company currently offers two-tier benefits structure:\n  - ~30 employees on MEC plan (paying ~$80/month for minimal coverage)\n  - ~5-10 administrative staff on Presbyterian Health Plan (company pays 50%, employee pays 50%, approximately $450 total)\n  - Total employee base: ~200 employees across two locations (Las Vegas and Santa Fe)\n\n- Pain Points Identified:\n  - Rising insurance costs creating affordability concerns for employees\n  - Employee uncertainty about whether they can afford coverage (\"everybody's questioning the amount of money\")\n  - Administrative complexity of managing benefits across two separate corporations\n  - Need for ACA compliance as an Applicable Large Employer (50+ FTE)\n\n- ICHRA Value Proposition Presented:\n  - Flexibility: Employees can choose from multiple carriers (Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Mexico, UnitedHealthcare, Presbyterian Health Plan)\n  - Reduced administrative burden: Thatch handles enrollments, compliance documents, COBRA notices\n  - Compliance assurance: Dynamic allowances ensure ACA affordability requirements are met\n  - Employee support: Access to advisors and self-service platform tools\n\nCompliance Requirements Discussed\n- ACA Affordability Standard: Employees must be able to afford lowest-cost Silver plan without spending more than 9.96% of annual income\n- Minimum Contribution: For hourly employees, employer must contribute 99% toward benchmark plan (25th percentile Silver plan) to remain compliant\n- Employee Classification: Can only group employees by employment type (full-time salary vs. full-time hourly), not by job title\n\nPricing Structure Presented\n\nHourly Employees (29 employees quoted as sample):\n- Monthly employer cost: $23,880 (includes contributions + platform fees)\n- Individual allowances range from $622 to $1,240+ depending on age and income\n- Example: Employee \"Alan\" receives $841/month allowance\n- Some Bronze plans would be fully funded; Silver/Gold plans require employee contribution\n\nSalaried Employees (3 employees currently):\n- Monthly employer cost: $3,000 for 3 employees\n- Could contribute 84% toward benchmark for compliance, but 99% recommended for fairness\n- Note: Lisa indicated ~10 administrative staff should receive higher allowances, but only 3 are currently classified as salaried\n\nEmployer Concerns Raised\n- Cost: Lisa expressed concern that total cost is \"a little high\"\n- Enrollment Uncertainty: Difficult to predict how many employees will actually enroll\n- Budget Constraints: Initial budget consideration was $200/employee, which would not meet ACA compliance requirements\n- Comparison Needed: Lisa wants to compare ICHRA costs against continuing MEC plan\n\n2. STAKEHOLDERS IDENTIFIED\n\nProspect Company Representatives\n\nLisa (Primary Decision Maker)\n- Role: President of Lazy SJ corporation\n- Responsibilities: Final approval on benefits strategy and budget\n- Key Concerns: Cost management, employee affordability, compliance\n- Contact: Email provided (to receive quote access)\n\nRick (Payroll Administrator)\n- Role: Manages payroll operations\n- Responsibilities: Payroll processing, benefits administration coordination\n- Systems: Uses ReadyPay Online RPO and Employee Navigator for open enrollment\n- Key Questions: Asked about contribution structures and cost implications\n\nJanice (HR Manager)\n- Role: HR, primarily for Santa Fe location\n- Responsibilities: Employee enrollment monitoring, benefits communication\n- Note: Will need training on Thatch platform administration\n- Challenge: Manages remote employees across two locations\n\nAlex (Benefits Advisor - Not Present)\n- Role: External benefits consultant/advisor\n- Previous Interaction: Met with Thatch team on December 15, 2025\n- Responsibilities: Provided initial company background, will help with decision-making\n- Next Step: Needs to be caught up on this conversation\n\nThatch Representatives\n\nJared Geredes\n- Role: Sales representative/Account manager\n- Responsibilities: Product education, quote preparation, account setup coordination\n\nMolly Marshall\n- Role: Sales support\n- Responsibilities: Demo support, enrollment process clarification\n\n3. IMPORTANT MILESTONES & TIMESTAMPS\n\nCritical Dates Identified\n\nDecember 22, 2025 (6 days from conversation date)\n- DEADLINE: Last day for employees to select plans for January 1, 2026 coverage\n- Risk: Very tight timeline given conversation occurred December 16\n- Consequence: Employees who miss deadline can only get coverage starting February 1, 2026\n- Compliance Note: No ACA penalty for missed deadline since offer was made before year-end\n\nJanuary 1, 2026\n- Target coverage effective date for enrolled employees\n\nKey Conversation Moments\n\n0:00-15:00 - Introduction & ICHRA Education\n- Jared explained ICRA model vs. traditional group insurance\n- Covered flat vs. dynamic allowances (dynamic recommended for ALE compliance)\n- Explained employee shopping experience and support options\n\n15:00-25:00 - Platform Demo\n- Demonstrated admin dashboard functionality\n- Showed employee onboarding flow\n- Clarified 60-day waiting period process for new hires\n- Lisa confirmed: \"It's pretty simple\"\n\n25:00-45:00 - Quote Review & Pricing Discussion\n- Reviewed hourly employee quote (29 employees sample)\n- Discussed compliance requirements (99% contribution minimum)\n- Lisa's reaction: Cost concerns expressed\n- Clarified two separate corporations require two separate Thatch accounts and invoices\n\n45:00-End - Plan Examples & Next Steps\n- Reviewed specific employee examples (Alan, Jason)\n- Compared to current Presbyterian plan costs\n- Discussed enrollment uncertainty\n- Confirmed no minimum enrollment requirements\n\n4. NEXT STEPS WITH DEADLINES\n\nImmediate Actions (By December 18, 2025)\n\nThatch Team (Jared):\n- [ ] Send quote access links to Lisa, Rick, and Janice\n- [ ] Catch up Alex on conversation outcomes and employer concerns\n- [ ] Verify ReadyPay Online API integration availability\n- [ ] Prepare comparison analysis: ICHRA costs vs. continuing MEC plan (if requested)\n\nProspect Team (Lisa/Alex):\n- [ ] Schedule follow-up meeting between Lisa and Alex to review quotes\n- [ ] Discuss budget implications and enrollment projections\n- [ ] Determine if administrative staff should be reclassified to \"salaried\" for higher allowances\n- [ ] Decide on dental/vision strategy (offer through Thatch or separately)\n\nDecision Required (By December 19-20, 2025)\n\nCritical Decision Point:\n- Determine if proceeding with ICHRA for January 1, 2026 effective date\n- If yes, must immediately begin employee communication and invitation process\n- If no, consider February 1, 2026 implementation or alternative solutions\n\nImplementation Tasks (If Proceeding)\n\nAccount Setup:\n- Finalize contribution strategy for hourly vs. salaried employees\n- Confirm employee classification changes (if any)\n- Upload employee rosters for both corporations (Lazy SJ and 7J's)\n- Configure two separate Thatch accounts with separate billing\n\nEmployee Communication (By December 20, 2025):\n- Send invitation emails to all eligible full-time employees\n- Provide enrollment deadline communication (December 22)\n- Offer Janice training on platform administration\n- Coordinate support for employees across Las Vegas and Santa Fe locations\n\nOutstanding Questions to Resolve\n\n1.

Administrative Staff Classification: Confirm which 10 employees should receive higher allowances and whether employment type changes are needed\n3. Dental/Vision: Decide whether to offer through Thatch or maintain separate arrangements\n4. Cost Comparison: Obtain MEC plan renewal costs for direct comparison\n5. Budget Approval: Confirm if $23,880/month (for sample 29 hourly employees) fits within company budget parameters\n\nRISK ASSESSMENT\n\nHigh Risk:\n- Extremely tight timeline (6 days to decision and employee enrollment)\n- Cost concerns may prevent moving forward\n- Enrollment uncertainty makes budgeting difficult\n\nMedium Risk:\n- Two separate corporations add administrative complexity\n- Remote workforce across two locations may complicate communication\n- Employee affordability concerns may result in low enrollment\n\nMitigation Strategies:\n- Expedite decision-making meeting with Alex\n- Provide clear cost comparisons to current plans\n- Consider February 1, 2026 implementation if more time needed\n- Emphasize no minimum enrollment requirement reduces financial risk\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES\n\n- Company is in peak season with many employees on overtime\n- Lisa mentioned FedEx relationship (company appears to be FedEx contractor/service provider)\n- Current benefits: \"Fedex isn't a high product\" - suggests limited benefits from FedEx\n- Employee sentiment: Shift from \"everybody wanted it\" to affordability concerns\n- Platform feedback: Lisa found demo \"pretty simple\" - positive signal for adoption\n\nRecommended Follow-up: Schedule 30-minute call with Lisa and Alex within 24-48 hours to address cost concerns and finalize decision before December 22 deadline."

            "transcript": "Jared Geredes:\nHi, Rick. Hi, Lisa. \nRick:\nHey, guys. Can you hear me? \nLisa:\nYes. \nJared Geredes:\nGreat to meet you. How's everybody doing? \nLisa:\nThank you. A little down with the cold, but other than that, good. \nJared Geredes:\nOh gosh, there's definitely something going around. I was sick, I feel like, for two weeks, and I'm finally like, 100% again. \nLisa:\nI know I have so many employees that are constantly in and out and good employees that are always like, I don't know what's going on. Like, I get it. Yeah. \nMolly Marshall:\nHope you feel better. Thank you. Happy holiday. Are there any more folks joining on your end? \nJared Geredes:\nAnd somebody muted, or Lisa, I think you muted if you're talking. And we could also jump into it. Alex, let us know that he might try to jump in, but that if he does, he's going to be a little bit late. And that we can get started without him. \nLisa:\nI have Janice online as well. \nJared Geredes:\nOkay. Sorry, HR. \nLisa:\nSo I kind of tapped her on. Perfect. \nJared Geredes:\nWell, Molly and myself, we work for Thatch. We met with Alex yesterday. He caught us up on your situation, your background and everything. So we're up to speed on everything. To set an agenda for today, I think there's like three kind of topics that we want to cover, three agenda items. Number one, we thought it would be helpful to cover a high-level overview. What is an ICRA? How does Thatch work? And how does thatch actually administer ICRAs? Number two, if it would be helpful for you, we can show you the full employee experience through a demo. So what your employees would be going through, onboarding, selecting a plan, what support they could get along the way. And then at the end of the call, which I think we should probably spend the majority of our time doing. Is discussing what your contributions could look like for next year. That's what we had in mind. This is your call, though. I want to make sure it's helpful. So let me know if that sounds good, or if we're missing something that you think would be helpful to cover. \nLisa:\nThat'll work. Beautiful. \nJared Geredes:\nLet's jump into it. And on a scale of one to 10, what's your familiarity with the Icra model? And one is completely okay. I just want a level set. \nLisa:\nI don't know nothing about it. Perfect. \nJared Geredes:\nOkay, we'll start from the very top. I'm very aware that, like, this is new for a lot of people. And it's very different than probably the traditional group insurance model that you're used to. So I'm expecting lots of questions. If at any point I explain something and it makes no sense, please stop me, interrupt me, let me know. I really want to make sure that we leave the call today. And you feel really confident with how this all works and what it all looks like. To set the stage, I usually find it helpful comparing to the traditional group insurance model, because that's what most people are familiar with. In traditional group insurance, you typically select one carrier and maybe one or two different plans to make accessible to employees. We're very different. You don't select a single carrier, you don't select just a couple of plans to make accessible to employees. You're actually going to have the ability to offer tons of different carriers and tons of different plans to your employees. So that they can pick a plan based off of their level of need, their family's level of need, their budget, all of that information that's important to them. And on top of that, all you have to do in this model is decide on a monthly health care budget to give to each employee that they can spend towards their individual health insurance. There's two different ways that you can structure these monthly budgets. Option number one is what we call flat allowances. Option number two is what we call dynamic allowances. I'll start with by describing, like, what a flat allowance is. And it's basically what it sounds like. You would be giving each employee the same dollar amount to spend towards their individual medical plan. I think something to take into consideration and why I don't typically recommend the flat allowance model is these individual plans. Will be priced based off of your employees age. So everybody's going to have a different price for their plans. Because of that, if you give everybody the same dollar amount, they're not going to have the same purchasing power. It won't be fair. Older employees, their plans are more expensive than younger employees. Because of that, I almost always recommend option number two, dynamic allowances, where we will actually base this dollar amount that you're giving to employees on their age. And on the back end, I make sure that that dollar amount will give each employee the same purchasing power. And because you're an applicable large employer, this is really the only direction I would recommend for you so that you're fully compliant with your allowances as well. We'll dig way deeper into that when we actually look into the quotes, but just want to let you know that there are two different ways you can structure budgets. After you give employees these dollars, they're going to shop for their insurance on thatch. So they're not going to the New Mexico State Exchange to pick a plan. Where they then have to submit a receipt for reimbursement. Everything happens on our platform, and this makes it easier for employees. It also makes it easier for you to manage. If an employee is given a budget of $750 and they pick a medical plan that is less expensive than their budget, which oftentimes isn't the case, they can use those leftover dollars towards their prescriptions, their co-pays, their deductible, as well as any qualified medical expense. So think of things like mental health care, telehealth services, all those different things. I just did a lot of talking. I'll take a pause here. Any questions, areas that you're confused about that I could maybe describe in a better way? \nLisa:\nNot yet. \nJared Geredes:\nOkay, we're on it. So, as I mentioned earlier, the great thing about this is you're going to be giving your employees lots of options. They're going to have several different carriers to choose plans from. While it's growing. Great to have a lot of options because everybody can right size their plan based off of what they need. It can also be overwhelming having a lot of choices. We understand this and we wanted to build our entire platform to make this process really easy for your employees. I'll show you this in the demo here in a second, But employees will have two different kind of support channels that they can use when they're actually selecting their plan. Option number one. They can schedule a call with one of our advisors where they can share their medications, the doctors they see, the hospitals they go to, their health history, anything that's important to them. And our advisors will look through all of the plans available and cherry pick a couple that they would recommend based off of what is shared. We also know people don't always like to talk to an individual about their health insurance and all that stuff. For those people, they can use our platform. They can input three pieces of information, how often they use insurance, what their budget is to spend out of pocket each month, And they can list all of the providers that they work with. And we will filter all the plans based off of that criteria as well. The last thing I want to share, and then we'll stop for questions, is administering an icra through Thatch. Our goal here is to take a lot of the administrative work off of your plate so that this is really running smoothly. What that looks like in terms of account setup, I set it up for you. All you need to decide on is how much money are we going to give to employees each month. After you finalize that, you share it with me. I create your account. We will upload your employees onto Thatch either through a payroll integration or we can manually upload the employees. And then we send invites to employees. They go shop for their plans on Thatch and they get enrolled for next year. Outside of account setup, we're handling all of the other admin tasks. So we process every single enrollment with each carrier. We will create and file all of the compliance documents for you at the end of the year. We send out cobra notices if you terminate an employee. And then, depending on what payroll system you use, we have different integrations with it. Which, Rick, I wanted to ask you, I know you're the... The man in charge of payroll. What payroll system do you use? \nRick:\nWe're on ReadyPay Online RPO. I don't know if there's an API to this, though. \nJared Geredes:\nOkay. ReadyPay Online. I'll double check. \nRick:\nThe only benefit of open enrollment is employee Navigator. Sorry, I was muted. \nJared Geredes:\nOkay. And you use employee Navigator. So, yeah, I'll double check if we have any type of API with ReadyPay Online. I think you're right. I don't think we do. That's not an issue. What we would just do is we would take your employee roster and then we would upload all those employees onto Thatch and then send invites directly from Thatch to those employees. Before we jump to a demo, I want to make sure we're in a good place here. Any questions, concerns that have come up so far? \nLisa:\nNo, not yet. Okay. \nJared Geredes:\nOn it, let's jump over to a demo. And so what I'm going to show you is both your admin dashboard, so basically what you would have access to see as an admin. We could get Lisa, you Janice, access to this Alex, and we could also get you access Rick. We would upload your employees, you're going to see all of your employees on your dashboard. I'll just create somebody for you right here so you can see. Everybody is going to populate in the not invited status so that you can select the employees that need to be invited to actually join that mid year. If you add any employees or terminate any employees, you would do it directly through that. So if you're adding them, you do that process. I just showed you. You click Add employee. You'd input their first name, last name and email address, and then we would send invites that way. If you're terminating employees. You would go to their row, click actions, Off board, and then you just check this box and click Off board employee. And they're basically off boarded out of our system. We're going to send them a cobra notice so that they can retain coverage if they want to. Other than that, you see at the very top, we're going to show you enrollment data. So where are your employees in this process? Who has not started enrollment? Who's currently in the process of enrollment viewing plans? Who's enrolled and who's declined. When it comes time to, when it comes time to inviting employees, you'll check their boxes, click Invite selected, and then you will invite those employees. When you invite them, they get an email to join Thatch. In that email, they have their own link that will take them to their personal Thatch account. We click Get started. They're going to create a password for their account. You click next. Step number one is for them to put in their basic background information. Based off of that information and the contribution strategy that we decide on together, your employees will see the dollar amount that you're contributing to them each month. Underneath that, they will be able to see where they can spend these dollars. Typically, it's medical, dental, vision, and other healthcare expenses. This might be a conversation for you to have with Alex, but offering dental and vision coverage through Thatch is completely optional. Alex might have something in mind for you, like offering dental and vision coverage outside of the platform, So we would just need to get that figured out before we set up your account. At the bottom of this page, if anybody wants to enroll their dependent in a plan, it's super easy. They click Add Dependent. They would input first name, last name, date of birth, and relationship. And they could do that process several times if they want to enroll multiple dependents. From there, inputting annual household income and tobacco usage. And then we get to, by far, the most important part of the process, where your employees are actually shopping for their medical plan. So we're going to show them every medical plan available in their area. We bring two plans to the top of this page, the lowest cost plan and the plan with the most comprehensive coverage. This is typically also the most expensive plan. When they get to this step, they have those two different options. They can schedule a call with an advisor so they can share their medications and their doctors, or they can do this fully self-serve. If they want to speak with somebody, they go to the bottom left, help and support. I need help deciding between plans. It will take them directly to our advisor's calendar, where they could schedule a call directly with them to speak with them and get recommendations. If they don't want to speak with anybody, they go to the top of this page and they can input those three pieces of information. How often do you expect to use your insurance? A little, somewhat often, a lot. I'll do a little. How much money am I willing and able to spend out of pocket each month? This should be on top of the allowance that you give them. And then last, but probably most important, is our provider search feature. So they can list all of the doctors that they currently work with, that their family currently works with. And when they're actually looking through plans, just pick two random people, when they're actually looking through plans, we're going to show them. Whether or not those providers are in network for that specific planning carrier. As we're going through this, you'll see we bring some of the like high level information to the top of each page. Deductible out of pocket, max, Co Insurance Co pays. I'll be honest, like, I think the average person doesn't know what a lot of these things mean, which is very understandable. That's why we have our advisors to support them through this process. And they can really give them that white glove experience, educate them on what they're picking and why they should pick this plan. Again, if somebody doesn't want to speak to anybody, but they have questions about what they're seeing, We do have a chat bot, which is called our Ask Thatch bot, where they can ask any question. They can say, what is a deductible? And they'll get an automatic answer for what a deductible is. If they want to speak with an advisor, they could do it in the bottom left. They can also just ask to speak with somebody live here. We're running through through this really quickly. Any questions? \nLisa:\nSo since we're here in New Mexico, is there just pretty much the MCOS here in New Mexico, or? \nJared Geredes:\nYeah. So when we look at the quote, I will show you all the different carriers that will be available to your employees. Yeah. If I remember correctly, because I was looking at your quote, I think it's three different carriers. Let's see. And we'll look at this deeper in a second. They'll have access to Blue Cross, Blue Shield of New Mexico. UnitedHealthcare and Presbyterian Health Plan. Okay. We'll jump back to that here in a second. Let me get back here. After they decide on the plan they want to pick, maybe they spoke with somebody, they'll click Select plan. After they enroll in a medical plan, they can then select dental and or vision coverage through Thatch if they want to. I'll select a dental plan, but I'll decline a vision plan. And then the final step. Is for us just to process their enrollment with the carrier. So we need a couple pieces of information and then usually one or two signatures, depending on which carrier they choose. And we click Enroll and it's really as easy as that. So the goal here is like, how can we make this consumer friendly. Avoid as much confusion as possible, and really handhold people through that entire process. They go to their dashboard. We're going to give them some tasks because as soon as they click enroll, we are ordering their insurance card to be sent to their home address. So, keep an eye out for member IDs, ignore payment reminders from the carrier, and if you have access to leftover dollars, to order their Thatch debit card. On their plan page or on their member page, they will see enrollment tracker of where their enrollment is in the process. When everybody receives coverage for January 1st, they will be showed in the enrolled status. Thoughts, questions? Is there anything you wanted to see? \nLisa:\nYeah, when we first enroll, I might get everybody's enrolling at the same time and then thereafter. Do you automatically send them, like, right now, everybody that starts, I think it's 60 days, Colonial will send them an invite for their insurance plan. Is that something you do, or is it something we're going to have to do? \nJared Geredes:\nIt is something that you will have to do on your end. So if you have a 60-day waiting period, when you add an employee here, you would want to schedule. Send that invitation to go out after 30 days so that they could get coverage after 60 days. \nMolly Marshall:\nIn terms of the enrollments and what have you, that's something that we all take care of on our end, in case that wasn't clear. \nLisa:\nSo once the employee comes in, they're at that 60 days, so we don't lose out and get into the 90 day. That's why we did it the 60 day. And then they contact you. And you help them out, we email them, or how does, is that what you're saying? \nJared Geredes:\nYeah, what we could do, and I think what's been helpful in the past, when you a new employee or hire somebody, if you want to email us that you added this employee. We can make sure that they get their invitation to get coverage after 60 days, okay, or you can send the invite out yourself. \nLisa:\nOkay, that'll work. \nJared Geredes:\nIs that helpful? I wasn't sure, that's completely clear. \nLisa:\nYes, yes, okay, Perfect. \nJared Geredes:\nAnything else that you wanted to see or were expecting to see in the onboarding part of this whole situation? \nLisa:\nNo, it's pretty simple. I'm sure some training for Janice will probably be the one to have to monitor it. \nJared Geredes:\nYeah, and we could totally do that. Like, at the end of the day, we're here to help your employees. And so if they have any questions, they can come directly to Thatch. They can reach out to our support team. And we'll make sure to get them covered. What I think we see, and what you should expect, is that your employees will probably reach out to either you or Janice. If that's the case, you can just then kind of pass them along to the Thatch support team and we'll make sure to get them handled. Because I think a goal here is to take a lot of this work off of your plate. Okay. \nLisa:\nAre you going to say something? Yeah, correct. Being that we're in two different locations, it's, I mean, Janice sees the people in Santa Fe. I mean, she doesn't see them. It's just pretty much once we enroll and then thereafter, she'll have to communicate with them. The ones in Las Vegas is not a problem. But do you guys come down on the first enrollment or is it all done by online? \nJared Geredes:\nIt's all done online. Okay. \nLisa:\nSo we would have to send emails to every employee and make sure every employee signs on, right? \nJared Geredes:\nWe will send the emails for you. Like, when you check their boxes and send out the invites, we then send emails to them with their invitation. \nLisa:\nOkay. And it all has to be done by the end of the month, right? Correct. \nJared Geredes:\nSo we are on a kind of short timeline now, just where we are starting this conversation. So your employees will have until... December 22nd to pick a plan for January 1st coverage. \nLisa:\nYikes. \nJared Geredes:\nYeah. And if anybody misses that deadline, they could get coverage for February. But like just with where we are in the month, there is that deadline of December 22nd. \nLisa:\nAnd do we, if we miss the deadline, do we get penalized with the ACA? \nJared Geredes:\nNo, because, you know, you won't, because you're... You technically offered health insurance before the start of the year, so you would not be penalized. I do have a question for you. How many employees do you expect to enroll? Because I know across the two different sites, you have like over 200 employees, or maybe just about 200 employees. Do you know how many you expect to enroll? \nLisa:\nWell, I know that currently, I think we have like 30 on the Met Plan. They were paying like 80 bucks for minimal. And I had, I think I had administration, we offered more. So we had like five on the Presbyterian plan. But I don't, everybody's, everybody's questioning the amount of money that's going to have to be paid now for insurance that is going higher. So I don't, I couldn't even come close to saying anything because I get a field. Like before, everybody wanted it and now it's like, we're not gonna be able to afford it, so it's back and forth. \nJared Geredes:\nYeah, okay, and I'm glad to hear that. So the the management tier right now, they're the ones that are offered the Presbyterian Health Plan. Yes, then the rest of the employees were on a mech plan. \nLisa:\nYes, and there's probably, um, three, let's see we have five, there's like nine, ten, there's like 10 administrative staff. \nJared Geredes:\nOkay, thank you. Okay. And when we talked with Alex, because he shared that. The way you're doing it today, that staff, they are all receiving some benefits, and then all the rest of your hourly employees are receiving the MEC plan. What I explained to him is that you can group your employees through an icra and offer a different contribution to them based off of their employment type. So we won't necessarily be able to categorize people based off of their title. However, it sounded like. All of the management tier, they're all full-time salary. And then the rest of your employees are full-time hourly. Is that correct? \nLisa:\nThat's correct. \nJared Geredes:\nOkay, perfect. So I think my recommendation here will be, we'll follow those two classes. So we'll offer one allowance to your full-time salaried employees, and then one allowance to your full-time hourly employees. \nLisa:\nAnd that's, well, I think mostly everybody's full-time because the census I sent, um, I think I had Rick Pull current. And again, we're right in the biggest peak ever. We haven't had a peak like this in who knows how many years, they said. But all our employees are at overtime right now. When it settles down, there is some that are not overtime, but it's only offered to the full-time employees. Am I correct? Yeah. 40 hours, 80 hours while they work. They get paid weekly, so it's 40 hours and higher. Correct. \nJared Geredes:\nOkay. Okay, on that topic, okay, so we can jump over to the quotes, and we'll look at two quotes, one for the salary, one for the hourly. In those two quotes, we uploaded the censuses that you shared with us. And I'm just setting the stage here. Because in the quotes, this is mainly for the hourly employees, we have every single one of your employees, every single one of your hourly employees uploaded into the quote. Which is going to be showing you numbers and costs based off of. If all of them enroll, that's probably not going to be the case. So we'll want to do some, probably like napkin math, based off of the amount of people that we're actually expecting to enroll. So that you can get a better idea of what the cost to your companies will be. Um, we'll start with the salaried employees, so the census I got, there were three people that were salaried. Is that not accurate? Because I think you mentioned 10. \nLisa:\nYeah, they're not paid salary. I guess I could change it on payroll. They're hourly, but they're administrative staff. I should have said that earlier. \nJared Geredes:\nOkay. And the goal would be to have all of the administrative staff to receive a higher allowance than the other people? Yes. Okay. So my goal here is for you to be fully compliant. So I'm just going to tell you, like, what you would need to be compliant. We could only group it based off of their employment type. So if you were interested in getting all 10 of those administrative tasks, I don't keep saying task, administrative staff, A higher allowance than the rest of the people, you would need to change their employment type to salary. Because I just want to make sure that you're compliant and not going to get dinged for any fees at the end of the year. Okay. And then on that topic, I guess, do you have a budget in mind, or a dollar amount in mind that you are, like, open or willing to spend towards the health insurance next year? \nLisa:\nWell, as far as employees, because me and Alex were talking, um, I mean, I was thinking just like 200 an employee, but with so many employees we have, I don't know. I'd have to see, but let's start with that. \nJared Geredes:\nYeah, So because you're an applicable large employer, so you have over 50 full-time employees, you have to offer what's considered an affordable allowance. What an affordable allowance means is that employees must be able to afford the lowest cost Silver plan in their area without spending more than 9.96% of their yearly income. So that's going to be the floor of what your contributions would be. I'll tell you right now, giving a $200 contribution to all of your hourly employees will not be compliant. So let's actually look at the hourly. People first before we talk about the rest of the people, because I think that's going to be the group. There's a lot more employees in there. So what I have it set up right now would be the minimum affordable contribution, basically the minimum amount that you could give to employees where you're fully compliant. As mentioned earlier, we have all 178 of your hourly employees in here, so the cost that you're seeing. Is assuming that all 178 of these people enroll, which is definitely not the case. You mentioned there's like, in reality, like 30 people that enroll. \nLisa:\nYeah. \nJared Geredes:\nSo what we can do here, and I might just want to rerun this quote really quick and just pick 30 different employees. So then I can give you, like, an estimate of what it would look like. There is going to be, this is going to be an estimation because we don't know how many employees enroll. But let's do that. I'm not sharing my screen. \nLisa:\nSo do you run the code together? I mean, I know there are two corporations. I'm the president, one, and my husband is the president, the other. Or do you run them separate because they're two separate corporations? \nJared Geredes:\nSo we'll have two separate Thatch accounts, one for each corporation. However, we can just create the quote and combine all of them together. So I guess this should have been titled differently. This is both. Lazy S.J. and seven Jays employees. Because at the end of the day, we're going to give everybody like the same structured allowance across those two accounts. But I don't know if that answers your question, But we'll have two separate accounts, but we can run the quote as if they're one group. Unless you wanted to see them separated. But I think that this is probably what would make more sense. \nLisa:\nSo if they're separated, what benefit does a company or the employee get if they're separated or together? \nJared Geredes:\nThere's no difference. \nLisa:\nOkay. \nJared Geredes:\nYeah, it's more just like, visually, if you wanted to know, like, what the bill would be for one corporation versus the other. I'm guessing that these are being funded through probably the same bank account. \nLisa:\nThey're both separate. They have to be separate. Build separate bank accounts. \nJared Geredes:\nYeah, still, I think it just makes sense to run it as a single quote. And then what we can think about is this, the dollar amount that we're going to see would be spread across two different bills. \nLisa:\nThere is more employees on Lazy than what there is in 7G. So, again, each one has to have their own invoice because they are separate. \nJared Geredes:\nOK, I got it. Yeah, that's totally OK. Let me rerun this quote, and I'll add just. 30 employees to it, so we can visualize what that would look like. Give me one second here, let's see 30. Make sure to love this. Thank you. Okay. Here we go. Let me just tag this as hourly. And I ended up doing, actually doing 29. But let me walk you through how this all works first. Let me bring this down as low as possible. It's going to be 97. Okay. So the first thing I want you to see is this monthly allowance column, where you're going to see every employee here is getting a different dollar amount. What we're doing is making sure that this dollar amount for Allen gives them the same amount of purchasing power as this dollar amount does for a Lexus. And then I think the goal here for the hourly employees, and please correct me if I'm wrong, but is to offer them the minimum. Allowance each month where you're fully compliant. So that's how this is set up right now. You'll see we have this compliance checklist here. If I bring your employer contribution down any lower than 99% towards this benchmark plan, let's just bring it down to 98 or 94, We're flagging all these employees for receiving an unaffordable allowance, which is not compliant. So what we need to do here if I toggle this up back to 99. Now you're fully compliant. I'm going to walk through what this actually means here. So to come to these dollar amounts, we have to pick a benchmark plan. Right now, we're benchmarking off of the 25th percentile of silver plans. All that means is we look at every Silver plan available to your employees. We stack rank them based off of premium cost. The 25th percentile of silver plans is like in that lower median level of silver plans. From there, you get to decide on how much, like what percentage of that plan are we going to fund. For each employees, 99 of this benchmark plan is as low as you can go. So if you wanted, we could dig into some of these employees and I could actually show you how much this purchasing power this gives them. Before we do that, I just want to talk about what the spend looks like for you. So you can look at this both monthly or annually. Do you have a preference of how you're looking at costs? \nLisa:\nMonthly. \nJared Geredes:\nOkay, if we're looking at monthly, the most important number here for you. \nRick:\nGary, can I ask one quick question? Yep. Hey, just quick. So what if Lisa decides that she doesn't want to contribute the same? Or give the the same purchasing power to each employee, just maybe just do the minimum for each employee? Does that change those costs from an employer standpoint? \nJared Geredes:\nSo the minimum for each employee is going to be different based off of their annual income. That's actually what I'm showing you right here. So the minimum allowance that's compliant for Alan is this $841. The minimum allowance for Alexis is the $622. And the reason that these numbers are pretty high is because these are hourly workers. And so they don't make exorbitant amount of money each year. And keeping in mind the compliance rule, we have to give them enough money to cover a plan without spending more than nine point nine six percent of their annual income. And please let me know if I'm like. Confusing you? No, Okay, Rick, what about you? \nRick:\nYeah, I think I missed the part where again, so there was to me, there was two options. One is she contributes the same amount to each employee, so that they have a different amount to each employee, so that they have the same purchasing power. Um, which I think would increase her, her cost, the employee, err, cost. Maybe I'm wrong, though. Or the second option is just contribute the 9.9% on the employees who are electing. So it could be lower depending on, you know, employees, with a lower cost. \nJared Geredes:\nYeah. So, the two options are giving employees a different dollar amount based off of that 9.96% of their annual income. That's what I'm showing you here. And then option number two was giving every employee the same dollar amount. So the example we were using earlier was $200, which wouldn't be compliant. If you wanted to give every employee the same dollar amount, it would actually increase the employer cost. Because what we would need to do for you to be compliant is basically match that dollar amount to be affordable, compliant. For the lowest income earner and the oldest employee. So I'm just looking at this right now. As an example, we would have to give every employee a thousand or $1,240 so that this employee is compliant. And then everybody, you would be overspending for everybody else. Got it. \nRick:\nSorry. Sorry about that. I get it. \nJared Geredes:\nNo, no, no, no. I think that's a good thing to like, clarify. No. So thank you for the question. So... My recommendation is this is going to be the minimum cost. For Lisa and her husband. And if we're looking at what that cost is, the most important number here is the total employer cost. This is the combination of the employer contribution plus our platform fees, which is access to our advisors, access to the platform, as well as our full compliance package. So all of the ACA reporting and compliance documents at the end of the year. And that grand total, if... For 29 employees to enroll, these are just the hourly employees would be 23, 880 per month. \nLisa:\nSo what you're saying is, let's just take Alan, for example, we would contribute 841 and then what would be his cost? \nJared Geredes:\nIt depends on the plan he picks. So if we look at Alan, we'll go to Alan, we can sort Bye. Let's start by Lowest premium. So there would actually be some bronze plans that would be fully funded to him, where he actually doesn't spend a single cent. On the other hand, maybe he wants to pick a more expensive plan with better coverage. Now I'm sorting by highest premium. If he picked one of these better plans, then these would be the contributions of what he pays each month. So it's really hard to predict what the employee will spend. What I can show you is are like examples of, OK, if they picked a low cost plan, what would they be spending? If they picked a high cost plan, what would they be spending? The number that is fixed here is what you are contributing each month. \nLisa:\nOK, I get it. \nJared Geredes:\nAnd let's go back here. I guess, how does this number sit with you? Is it making you fall out of your seat? \nLisa:\nYeah, it does. Because just because, I mean, Fedex isn't a high product, it might seem, but I mean, again, Fedex are the ones that make the money. I'm just trying to see with, you know, so many employees, you know, I'm trying to get an accurate number on that. Met plan really quick for us, just to get an idea. But I don't, it's a little high. And I think it's going to be, I don't know if that many employees would enroll, neither. So it's kind of fishy for me on that end. \nJared Geredes:\nYeah. Yeah, I think that's like the most difficult thing to predict is. How many employees are actually going to enroll. And that obviously affects what the cost of this is to you. I think this is a good starting place because it's kind of based off of who's currently enrolled. But I hear you. Yeah, it might be worthwhile to see what the, if you were to keep everybody on a MEC plan, what the cost of that would be. My guess is it will be cheaper for you. This is the hourly quote. If we want, we can also jump to the salaried quote. So this is just for the three people that are currently salaried. This would change if you end up changing people to salaried. This group of people, because they're higher earners, you could actually reduce the contribution percentage for them. Because their compliance, basically threshold, is going to be a different amount based off their annual income. I don't think that was necessarily the goal. I think the goal was to actually give these people more money. However, just to show you and to reference on the other quote, to be considered affordable, compliant, you had to contribute 99% towards this benchmark plan. For these employees, you could contribute 84% towards the benchmark plan. And keeping in mind your goal of kind of giving these people better, or at least the same coverage. I think my recommendation would be we probably give everybody a 99 contribution towards this benchmark plan, so then it's fair, or you could increase this amount, of course, if you want. Um, but if these three people were to enroll and we kept the same benchmark contribution structure, your total employer cost for this group of people would be $3,000 per month. Is there anything else that would be helpful for me to show you? \nLisa:\nSo can you split? I mean, look at one of the employees, because, like right now with press. I mean, currently we pay half, I know they're going up, but they pay half too, so it's about 450. So just to see what that employee would be paying like, just try it at. Jason. \nJared Geredes:\nYeah, do you know what Presbyterian plan you're offering today? We have to talk about, I think it's the silver, pressed silver. There's two different silver press plans here. Actually, there's a handful. There's a lot of different silver Presbyterian plans. Okay. But you can see, so like, a couple of these. You would be actually fully funding. So it would be at zero cost for employees. And a couple of them, they would be contributing anywhere between 50 to 100 or $265. Okay. So from here, so kind of like, a couple different directions we can go. I'm going to send you, Janice, Rick, if it would be helpful for you to see, I can send you all access to these quotes. I think what we should probably do is we should either regroup with Alex or Lisa. If you have a direct line to Alex, maybe schedule some time with him to discuss these quotes, your options, and then we can figure out kind of the right direction for you and your companies. \nLisa:\nThat'll work. Okay. \nJared Geredes:\nI'm going to send you these quotes. If you have any direct questions for myself or Molly, anything that's related, you're going to have access to my email. So, please feel free to share any questions. I will catch Alex up with kind of where we left off the conversation. And then I would also encourage you to maybe schedule some time with him so you could speak about it. \nLisa:\nSo let's just say if, I mean, out of everybody you have there, I mean. If only three want to sign up, do they still qualify? Yes. Or do they have to have a certain amount of people to qualify? \nJared Geredes:\nSo you have to invite all of your full-time eligible employees. However, there are no minimums for how many people enroll. You could have one person enroll and you're only paying for that one person. You could also have 50 people enroll, and then you'd be paying for those 50 people. Okay, I got it. \nLisa:\nI think I got it. \nJared Geredes:\nOkay. I'm expecting there'll be some questions that come up after you digest all this. So please see us as a resource. I don't want to just give you all this information and leave you high and dry. And then we should regroup with Alex to figure out the best way forward. \nLisa:\nOkay, that'll work. \nJared Geredes:\nAlrighty. It was great to meet you, Lisa. Great to meet you as well, Rick and Janice. Um, and we'll talk soon. All right, thank you, all right, bye-bye, take care, thank you. \n",

            "transcript": "Monica Hirschheimer:\nHi Libby, how are you? \nLibby O'Malley:\nHi, I'm fine. How are you? \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nI am doing well. It's great to meet you. \nLibby O'Malley:\nNice to meet you. I'm sorry for the delay. Um, that's okay, I. We've got Zoom workplace and we've got, fathom it sat, fathom, like, over what God I look like. Hell, Um, I have. My little girl is home with strep throat today. Man, my throat starting to bother me. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nAnd I'm like, oh, gosh, man. Hopefully, if anything, just at least before the holidays and everything. \nLibby O'Malley:\nYeah, I just hope. Yeah, so we'll see. So thank you so much, Monica. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nYou're so welcome. \nLibby O'Malley:\nLook forward to chatting and learning more vaguely familiar with that. Monica. My Monica from Laundry. Guys, and I'm ready to just jump in and see how quickly we can get things rolling. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nOkay, that sounds great. I have a few questions for you, just to get some context on your group. I guess, how many total employees do you have? \nLibby O'Malley:\nSix employees total, four full-time, two part-time, all located in six different states. Awesome. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nJust curious, do you know the states off the top of your head? \nLibby O'Malley:\nI do. Texas, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nNice. Cool. Okay. And then will you be offering benefits to both full-time and part-time employees? \nLibby O'Malley:\nNo. In fact, of the six of us, only two need insurance. Okay. Three have it through spouses or military. One has it through Medicare. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nSpouse slash military, one through Medicare. And actually, anyone on Medicare can also get their premiums reimbursed via an Icra benefit as well. So they can opt into that as well. You would be, I guess, sort of... Hmm. Sort of you'd be required to like offer the icra benefit. So, out of curiosity, the two people who need insurance and the person who has Medicare, are they all full-time or some full-time versus part-time? What's the breakdown there? \nLibby O'Malley:\nAll three of those individuals are full-time. Got it. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nOkay, cool. And then my other question would be for you. Like, are you looking to start something for January 1st, which is possible, but we can also have a later start date as well. \nLibby O'Malley:\nYeah, no, we're looking asap of the two of us. Actually, I mean, I'm hoping this isn't a factor. Actually, one, so it's myself and I'm an individual. Just it's me. I have a daughter. She is Medicare, Medicaid. I can never remember, but we're fostered. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nMedicaid if she's under 65. Okay. \nLibby O'Malley:\nSo she's covered until she's 18 with that. And then Ashley, the second employee who needs it, is recently pregnant. And so we're looking to figure out for her and her husband and her baby when the baby arrives. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nThat's awesome. Yeah, once you have a baby, then that would be a qualifying life event to add them onto your plan. So don't do anything too crazy now. But, of course, they might want to consider what the plan looks like for a child on the way. Okay, that sounds good. And let me think if I have any other questions. I guess the two other questions I have is everyone who needs insurance is a W-2 employee. Is that right? \nLibby O'Malley:\nCorrect. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nOkay, great. And then what payroll system do you use out of curiosity? \nLibby O'Malley:\nGusto. Nice. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nOkay. All right. Well, let's just jump right in. As I pull up a couple of things, do you have any questions off the bat that I can... Answer quickly, or I'll just say, we'll get to it. Anything at all. \nLibby O'Malley:\nNo, I mean, the main thing is is how quickly can we get it in place? And yeah, and you know, is pregnancy a pre-existing condition? \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nNo, no, it's not. it is not a pre-existing condition. So Asha would be able to get coverage, that's no problem. And how quickly can you get things into place, as quickly as we as we move it along? So January 1st is the next coverage start date, obviously. And where did my share button go? There we are. And right now, employees have to choose plans by the end of the day on December 22nd for January 1st coverage. But I would expect that to be pushed out, maybe, like. Two days. We just don't have that finalization. You're like, okay, we're doing it. Okay, great. Well, I'll stick with you on that timeline. That's totally fine. This is kind of like crunch time for everyone, people who want plans and also myself. So if someone says, I want insurance for January 1st, it's still possible. And if you miss the deadline, then you might have a lapse in coverage. So we're working as hard as we can to get people enrolled. So I'll go through some info on that. And then I'll show you what it looks like, how you get into the system and actually choose what your allowances would be, and maybe you have a budget in mind already. So we can kind of talk through that or how you might get to that point. So I'll go through a little bit of info that I think is important for you to know. And then we'll get into, like, what the system actually looks like so you can play around it, Okay, So at the end of the day, what we're trying to do is build a health care system people love. It is a little difficult to do, but we do it as best as we can trying to implement. What this is, is an ICRA, an individual contribution health reimbursement Arrangement. So I'm a type of HRA. Where you're, as the employer, going to give a pre-tax allowance to yourself, Ashley, the Medicare employee, if they want to accept it or not. And you'll be able to have that go towards your premiums. That can be an insurance plan that's direct on that just platform. Those are the same as the individual plans you would see on someone's state marketplace, or you can even go to your state marketplace. Maybe some people have a plan through their state exchange already and bring that plan directly into that, so you do have those options there when you choose an allowance, how it works. As a basic example, let's just say you choose to give everyone $750 a month. Then they would choose a medical plan in our system. Let's just say it's 500 and then any remaining dollars, so 750 minus 500, we've got a remaining 250 there if there's any remaining funds. Someone can use that on other qualified medical expenses, like prescriptions, co-pays, you know, over-the-counter medications, mental health therapy sessions, whatever would be technically HSA FSA eligible. So there's some flexibility in how they choose a plan. Go ahead. \nLibby O'Malley:\nNo, I'm just giving a thumbs up. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\noh, thumbs up. Okay, great, wasn't really hold on one second. Um, but any any questions there? \nLibby O'Malley:\nUm, well, I, I. My main question that I have is when we get to is sort of like, we're talking like a dollar amount. And what I was reading, I felt like it was referring to, like percentages or something like that. Um, and so I'm trying to figure out, sort of, as you know, my whole thing is is equity amongst the employees and the staff. And we have, you know, so again, with myself and Ashley, I'm an individual, but older, I just turned 60. And, you know, Ashley's, 31, or 32, would be her husband and her child. And I'm just trying to figure out, like, how do I? And we're a nonprofit. So I'm trying to figure out, like, how do I go back to the board and make a recommendation? Is it just a flat dollar amount? Is it, you know, I? I guess what I'm trying to figure out is what options do I have in order to, quote, make the policy? And I don't mean the insurance. I mean, like, what is our internal policy coverage for? This is what we're going to do so that we can budget across the board for the organization consistently. And if Ashley leaves tomorrow, when we bring somebody else in, how does that work internally? And I'm really looking for sort of your advice on best practices. Recognizing that, yeah, we make the decision, but I'm not really sure how others structure it. That's my big, that's for me the big thing I need to figure out. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nYou ask and really relevant. There are a few ways that you can do it. And I, if you wanted to do something equitable or not, either way, but I liked that you said equitable. Because one of the ways that you can do allowances is specifically for equity, right? You and I live in different states, like I live in New York, so none of your employees live there, right? I need a different amount of money to get myself, let's say, a gold plan, than someone else does in Pennsylvania for a gold plan. Because in New York, it's not based off of age, they don't have that. So it's, you know, I don't know, a gold plan could be like $1,500. Whereas a gold plan for a 30 year old in Pennsylvania is only like $800, maybe, depending on different factors. So, yes. \nLibby O'Malley:\nThe seven or eight states that are unusually high and like location into account. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nExactly. That's exactly it. So when you get into it, we'll just kind of jump into this, and it's a relevant question now. So when you get into the system and I'll send you a link to get here, you'll create an account, put your employees in. I think I'd probably put in all six of your employees. Anyone that you would potentially give insurance to, like give the benefit to, even if they don't need it, because technically, like, you have to offer it to everyone. And it's up to them if they choose to take it or not, which it sounds like three people won't take it. But you want to, you have to offer it to them. So when you put everyone in, then you'll go to next step and you'll confirm these are the people. And then you'll be actually be able to like modify. Oh, actually, it was to February. It's thinking in the system that it's too late, but it's not too late. We'll go to next. And we've got these two options, like you just said, of how we're going to do the allowances. So on the same dollar amount side, you're just giving everyone a flat amount, 500, 600, 1000 dollars, whatever amount it is, could be relevant to you to break it up by state, which you can do. So you can say, all right, everyone in Texas gets. $500 Everyone in North Carolina gets $600. You could add additional amounts for dependents as well if someone has dependents they want to put on their plans. So this is a more equitable way than just saying same dollar amount to everyone. But you can become even more equitable by doing a smart allowance because that will take into consideration someone's age. With your group, it won't matter a ton because you have everyone is in different states. So, like, you could make smart allowance or state allowances both equally equitable. But on the smart allowance side is really where you're going to get to modify this as much as you want and get super granular with it. So, as an example, like, just to keep it easy, Bob, I know as an individual, he's in California. He's 35 years old. So for Bob, who's 35, he needs $850 to afford a home. 100%, the employer is going to pay 100% of a median silver plan, which is this. This is what this is benchmarking off of. This is a median bronze plan, median silver, median gold. So he needs $850 to afford in his area for his age, a median silver plan when the employer is going to cover 100% of that. If you want to offer him better benefits or the entire team, you're like, you know, I want to contribute 100% to a median goal plan. Wherever someone lives and how old they are. Then you click Better Benefits and the allowances will be modified there. And then, of course, dependent coverage here. How much do we want to add to someone's allowance? Depending on how many dependents they have, and depending what your contribution and your budget is going to be as the employer. Thoughts here. Questions here. \nLibby O'Malley:\nYeah, no, this is helpful. This is definitely helpful. And, and, and I mean, I think we don't, we don't, I really don't think we'll have anybody going anywhere. I mean, if anything, we'll be adding employees. I guess the question is, is if I, you know, with taking into a state consideration, I'm just trying to think ahead, which I really don't think it's going to be. I don't think we're going to be hiring anybody full time. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nAnd are you thinking about someone like, out of like, if they move, or hiring someone from a new state that you don't currently represent? Right. \nLibby O'Malley:\nRight. Hiring someone from a new state. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nSo if that happens, then you would choose the allowance at that time. So if you did hire someone in New York or New Jersey, or you don't have someone living, you would choose that allowance then, because otherwise you'd have to choose an allowance for. All 50 states right now, and we wouldn't make you do that, that's crazy, so we don't have time for that. Um, yeah, so you could do that another time, okay, and gosh, it went in my brain. \nLibby O'Malley:\nAnd um, I saw maybe a couple slides ago. It had like the 500, 150 and then there was like a credit card and it was like 750, so it added up to 650. D. And so I guess the question is, you know, what is this? \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nYeah, sure. So if you have leftover dollars, so we got it remaining. This is examples of what you could use your funds on. But this remaining 250, anything would go on to a thatch debit card. And then employees can use that Thatch debit card at the pharmacy, the doctor to pay for their copays or prescriptions. They can request a physical card, or, if they want to just use their own credit card, cash, their own debit card at the pharmacy. I usually do my own credit card and then I just upload the CVS receipt or whatever receipt to Fatch, and Fatch reimburses me $10. Or however much my prescription is. And that $10 comes out of my total. Budget for the month. \nLibby O'Malley:\nOkay, gotcha. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nThat I'm given by my employer. So that's where the funds will go. If you're also like figuring out budget, and you're on a tighter budget, There are some employers who choose to turn this ability off for people to use remaining funds on out of pocket expenses. That's totally fine. So you would just let me know if you'd like to do that as well. \nLibby O'Malley:\nOkay, and I think what is what's throwing me is like, so you've got your premium that they choose. But what is the $100 for the marketplace? \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nGood question. This is a little misleading. The marketplace is something, I think it's right here. This is a part of thatch that everyone has access to. Excuse me. It's like a platform of health and wellness vendors that Thatch partners with. So if people do have leftover funds and they want to use it on, like... Um, a prescription, a subscription to, like, a mental health therapy, like Better Help, or um, some kind, like an Aura Ring or other type of wellness services. Then we kind of give employees the access to getting those services. Rather than you as the employer partnering yourself with Aura Ring or Better Help or something, so we kind of make that partnership for you. Um, you don't have to use your funds there. Obviously, it's for any age of the F.SA, um, qualified. \nLibby O'Malley:\nPortals are really, I mean, totally, I agree, just customer feed or user feedback. I would just be like, marketplace health. There's only one thing that has that connotation, I mean, and that's the state. Yeah, network, the thatch, yep, community, that or something, but that's marketplace. I was like, Wait, it's confusing. Yeah, it's confusing. Okay, totally agree. all right, that's helpful. Um, Okie, doke, Um. So we can go back to where we were, Sure. And go for it. And I think, I think, I mean, this will be so. I've had two presentations that Monica did on that. One of them was I interviewed for a job last February of last year, February 25. And when I was shown the benefits package, it was like, ICRA. And I was like, Monica, have you ever heard of this? Because I know she's an HR pro. And she's like, oh, yeah, we've done that for launch. And she's like, it's so funny. I'm doing a presentation on it tomorrow. And I was like, all right. And so. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nOh, how nice. \nLibby O'Malley:\nYeah, it was perfect timing. And so I learned about it there. And then I was hired as the executive director for a different organization. The one I'm the executive director for now. Nice. They sent me the package. I was like, there's no, y'all have no benefits. And they're like, no. And they're like, yeah, I was like, well, then you're going to have to pay me more. And well, as executive director, you're, that's your job to figure that out. And so that's where I am right now is, I'm figuring it out. And so it was funny. I mentioned it to Monica in the car the other day. She's like, I'm doing another Ichra presentation. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nIs that true? \nLibby O'Malley:\nNo. She said, no, she told me, she said, I can connect you to Thatch. I'm doing a presentation on something called Doctegrity, which is pretty cool. Oh, I do? \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nYeah, it's cool. \nLibby O'Malley:\nSo I did. I attended that yesterday. And it's not health insurance at all. I mean, it's not intended to replace health insurance, but it's actually very similar to what your marketplace looks like. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nGot it, got it. \nLibby O'Malley:\nAnd it's, you know, it's fairly inexpensive. I don't know, 20 bucks, 25 bucks a month, blah, blah, blah. So, yeah, so this is and in the last couple of weeks, we are board met a week ago, Friday. So what five days? And they're like, you know, you'll have to get insurance. And I had just pulled a number out of the air with the intention of knowing that. All six of our people. Didn't need insurance, but thinking, the two of us that do right, we'll get that. But I've got to give these other four people something, something. Yeah, you know, increase their salary or whatever. And I was, again, I'm all about like, I mean, we're a team, we've worked, we work really well together, we're very tight. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nIt's great. \nLibby O'Malley:\nAnd I mean, I've only been there again again since April. And, um, wow, the board was kind of like, oh, well, you know, they'll be fine. They'll just be so excited that you all have health insurance. I'm like, so anyway, they're like, just get you two health insurance. And, and, um, and I just don't have an appreciation. This is a, it's a weird board. I haven't figured them out yet. All right. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nAll right. \nLibby O'Malley:\nAnd I'm on sort of shaky ground with them, quite honestly. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nI see. \nLibby O'Malley:\nWhich I've never in my life been on shaky ground with a board. Very long story. That's hard. And they, I don't know whether they're going to be like, I, the only time I've ever worked for an organization. That 100% of anything was covered for health insurance-wise was the federal government. I mean, when I worked, you know, I was a civilian that worked for the Navy, and, you know, they paid for everything. And then when I worked for state government here in North Carolina and city government in Virginia, both times, they paid the vast majority of the premium. I worked for a nonprofit that covered the whole. Kitten, right? So that's where I'm a little like, I mean, how much do y'all want to pay, right? \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nIs there any like number that they have, like total or per person, that they're thinking about? \nLibby O'Malley:\nNo, and um, and and so I'm curious, what, what do you? what do you tend to see? I mean, in your experience? I mean, seven, 750. I mean, I will tell you, like my marketplace, when I'm paying for for the marketplace right now is just shy of a thousand dollars. And I'm 60 years old. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nYeah. Healthy. \nLibby O'Malley:\nDon't smoke. Yep. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nNever been knock on wood. \nLibby O'Malley:\nYou know, I've never been hospitalized. Right. You know, that kind of thing. Right. You know, so I'm thinking, like, well, a thousand dollars seems high to me. Like, I mean, I'm like, so. Yeah. What number do you, I mean, 750, when that popped up there, I was like, you know, I mean, that's a decent number. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nYeah. It's, and I haven't, I work only with small businesses. So I usually work with employers who have one to 10 employees. So I would say, typically it's hard to say on a flat allowance side, because then that's really like, well, we have $2,000 to use every month. So we're just going to do 500 per person. We have four people. So that's a little bit more cut and dry. But then on the percentage side, what you can do, there are two things I like to think of. First, at the end of the day, my background is in public health, so I always want to be like, everyone gets benefits, everyone gets as much money as possible. But then I work with businesses, I'm working with employers. So I think of budget first, which is why I asked, do they have a number? So what I would like to think about is, how much are they willing to spend per? Person per month, or maybe per month as a whole, and this would be that number here. So let's just say you are hoping to get to like, four thousand dollars for your group. That's just as an example, since we have these people here. You can play around with the benchmarks here to get yourself closer to that four thousand dollar number here. So that, right? This is taking us down on to 54. Now, if we scroll down all the way, maybe we're getting closer to more. Like, you're covering 65% of someone's silver plan, and that's still offering some dependent coverage, too. So I like to move around with that to start and think about the budget, but also thinking about covering more than 50% of a median silver plan is pretty good. That's decently competitive. You're not saying I'll pay. 50% of the cheapest plan you have available to you. So you're still getting something. And then what you could look at when you go to see plans for each person, yourself and Ashley, and maybe the Medicare individual as well, is, all right, how much money is going to be left over for them? And how much are they going to be paying out of pocket for all these other plans here? So when it says employee pays, this means that the allowance is $1.94. Less than what the total premium is. So the employer or the employee would have to pay out of pocket, which would be a pre-tax monthly, sorry, a pre-tax payroll deduction. And as you go down the list, you can see, obviously, the employee pays goes up a little bit as the plans get more expensive. So, you know, I'd want to see, I can't say, like, you know, I want to see. 50% of the plans be 100% covered. That's in an ideal world, sure. Most employers have employees contributing something. It is not the norm, at least for what I see, that employers are covering 100%. That's like pretty rare, I would say. It happens, but not a lot. So that's where my mind goes to start is budget. And then what is, you know, a competitive ish type of structure that you would do. Okay. That's where my head goes first. Yeah. \nLibby O'Malley:\nYeah. I hear you. No, that's helpful. Yeah. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nUm, I have a, I have another call, but I think if you're okay with it, I'll send you the info to get into the system or put your employees in, and then I'll send you my calendar link. Um, somehow it's very slow this week, even though it's busy time. I guess my calendar is open because people know what they're doing for their coverage already. So I'm trying to just offer more time to actually get people going, rather than just sending you to the wolves and doing it yourself. It should be easier than being sent to the wolves. But get going, put it in the system, And then, if you have questions about how the allowances work and then what next steps look like, I'm happy to meet and have another call with you as well. \nLibby O'Malley:\nOkay, Monica, that would be lovely. That would be great. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nI will definitely do that. I'll send you a follow up right after our call and then you can reach out to me at any time. \nLibby O'Malley:\nOkay, that sounds perfect. All right. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nIt was great meeting you, Libby. \nLibby O'Malley:\nA pleasure to meet you. Thank you for your time and you're so welcome for me again. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nOkay, sounds good. Enjoy the rest of your day. Take care. \nLibby O'Malley:\nThanks. Bye. Bye. \n",

The company uses multiple carriers based on geographic location: Kaiser for the majority of employees in California, and UnitedHealthcare (UHC) for employees in other states including Arizona, Texas, Florida, and New Mexico.\n\nThe current plan structure offers limited options, with each individual employee having access to only one plan choice. For the Kaiser plan in California, employees currently pay approximately $209 out of pocket per month for employee-only coverage. The Kaiser plan is an HMO with a $0 deductible, while the UHC plan is a PPO with a $1,000 deductible. The plan includes specific deductibles, copays, pharmacy benefits, and out-of-pocket maximums, though exact plan design details were not explicitly stated in the conversation.\n\nThe company is facing an 11.8% renewal increase, with estimated renewal costs of approximately $2,495 (likely in thousands based on context). Their current renewal date is April 1st. In addition to medical coverage, the company maintains separate dental and vision plans that are structured as limited benefit products.\n\nThe company has experienced challenges with their group plan structure, including significant turnover (common in retail), variable renewal rates over the years, and anti-selection issues due to low participation rates. The lack of healthy premium from non-participating employees has contributed to renewal instability."

They face recurring double-digit renewal increases and have a low participation rate in their current health plans. The ICHRA proposal aims to provide cost control, predictability, and administrative simplification.\n\n- Current Situation: The company has approximately 700 eligible employees, with only 219 participating in health plans. They currently offer Kaiser HMO in California and UnitedHealthcare PPO for out-of-state employees. The current renewal is projected at an 11.8% increase.\n\n- ICHRA Proposal: The proposed ICHRA cost is $2,411,000 annually, with a flat cost share model introduced to cap employee out-of-pocket costs. The proposal includes a Gold One benchmark plan, offering flexibility and employee choice.\n\n- Benefits Highlighted: For the employer, ICHRA offers budget predictability, access to a larger risk pool, and reduced administrative complexity. For employees, it provides plan options, licensed advisor support, and the ability to apply unused allowances to qualified medical expenses.\n\n2. Stakeholders Involved:\n\n- Daniel's Jewelers:\n  - Joe Donaghy (JMD) - CFO, primary decision-maker, responsible for financial strategy and final approval.\n  - Cindy Stein (CCS) - VP of HR, responsible for benefits administration, employee communication, and transition management.\n\n- Plexus Group:\n  - Dan Wilke - Lead Benefits Consultant, responsible for strategy advisory and analysis review.\n  - Beth Hannes - Supporting Consultant, involved in employee support and implementation considerations.\n\n- Thatch:\n  - Tom Hemmingsen - Benefits Advisor, responsible for ICHRA proposal and analysis.\n  - Kaitlin Zidar - Solutions Consultant, responsible for technical expertise and implementation support.\n\n3. Important Milestones and Timestamps:\n\n- Historical Context: Daniel's Jewelers first explored ICHRA in 2024 but did not proceed. In 2025, they committed to a full evaluation as a cost control strategy.\n\n- Recent Developments:\n  - December 2, 2025: Initial ICHRA presentation.\n  - December 4, 2025: Analysis review meeting determined ICHRA was not a good fit initially.\n  - December 5, 2025: Further discussion on ICHRA structure and employee impact.\n  - December 16, 2025: Proposal review with updated analysis and flat cost share model.\n\n4. Next Steps with Deadlines and Responsible Parties:\n\n- Immediate Actions:\n  - Share updated analysis spreadsheet with Joe and Cindy by December 16, 2025.\n  - Add benchmark plan details to the analysis within 2-3 days.\n  - Conduct multi-state plan analysis before the next meeting.\n  - Perform employee-level disruption analysis before the next meeting.\n\n- Short-Term Actions:\n  - Schedule a follow-up meeting in late December 2025 or early January 2026.\n  - Arrange a reference customer call for Cindy and Joe.\n\n- Medium-Term Decisions:\n  - Final decision on ICHRA adoption by January 2026.\n  - Determine the strategy for unused allowance dollars"

The administration appears to rely on the broker relationship with Plexus for consulting and strategy, combined with direct carrier relationships for enrollment and claims management.

Every call just becomes, okay, hang in there. It's eight more days. Hang in there. Seven more days. Hang in there. That's good. \nMitchell Andrews:\nAnd then you hit the cash register. \nCindy Stein:\nWell, you know, everyone's tired and working long hours, and customers are demanding. \nMitchell Andrews:\nWait, does that mean cranky and crabby? Is that the insinuation? People get cranky and crabby? \nCindy Stein:\nOh, geez, do they get cranky and crabby. So I spend my time being these next eight days, I spend my time being a counselor, saying, just hang in there. It's going to be all right. You're going to get through. Meanwhile, I'm gnashing my teeth myself, saying, God damn it, I haven't even done my shopping yet. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nHard to be a leader, right? \nCindy Stein:\nBut it happens every year, so I know what to expect. \nDan Wilke:\nGood. \nMitchell Andrews:\nYou're a professional. \nDan Wilke:\nListen to it. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nAll right. Should we assume we should wait for Joe? \nCindy Stein:\nYeah, let me just send him a real quick text. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nOkay, thank you. \nMitchell Andrews:\nYeah, give him the crabby text. \nCindy Stein:\nThe crabby one? Yeah. Yeah. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nAnd Cindy, were you just referring to, like, this is your all's busiest time, with the holidays and all the shopping that everyone's doing and everything? \nCindy Stein:\nYeah, it gets pretty crazy right now. Well, you know, the malls in general. Normally, where we are located in a mall, there are other jewelers around us. So it becomes very competitive. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYeah. \nCindy Stein:\nWho can get to them first, and then once they're there, who can keep them? \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYeah. I remember there's a famous jewelry mart in San Francisco, at least famous in the San Francisco Bay area, when I bought my wife's wedding ring. I remember going in there and there was like 15 different stores. And I was just thinking through the dynamics of the competitiveness. And I went to the one I went to just because it was where someone said, hey, I use them. So I'm sure for you all, that word of mouth is extremely important. \nCindy Stein:\nRight. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nThe marketing with luxury jewelry can be really interesting. My cousin ran this company where they partnered with this one jewelry business. And they gave, like, I think it was $500 to the store if you spent a certain amount. And then he was sharing some of the statistics and he was like, the results were amazing. Where some people went and spent $499, and then other people went and spent like 10 grand. And the employer was so happy because those few people were such influential new customers that were like, that was worth the entire campaign. Yeah, so unpredictable. \nMitchell Andrews:\nJoe, we're coming up with ways to help boost sales. Does that make you happy? \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYeah, you came for benefits, but we pivoted sales acceleration. \nJMD:\nMy cousin from Chicago just called me to get earrings for his wife. So we are open for business. \nMitchell Andrews:\nDid you charge him double? \nJMD:\nHe's charging more than I pay. \nCindy Stein:\nIf anyone has a million dollar order that they need to place, we'll process it. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nTake care of it. Joe, thanks for joining. So goal of the call today is, I know we left the last meeting, right? We understood, hey, like, voting icra compared to group can be quite confusing. And so we kind of did the first version of the quote. And then, as I recommended, there's another approach we can take. Which more mimics the group insurance space. And I'll get to that. But really, the goal of the call is to review that, help you all understand. Kind of the different levers that we have in terms of your costs and the things that we can change. And then looking at some disruption for employees as well. And then just, you know, aligning on next steps and going from there. Got one intro on my side. I want to introduce you to Caitlin, who you all just met, but I want her to just do a quick intro. And then we can jump in. But in terms of an agenda, does that sound good to everyone? Yep. Yes. Awesome. Well, excited to introduce you all to Caitlin. Caitlin is my partner. She's on our Solutions consulting team. So think of her as a kind of benefits analyst and is really my right-hand partner to help you all through this evaluation. So, Caitlin, if you want to do a quick introduction, that'd be great. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nYes, nice to meet you all. To give you a little bit of background about myself, I've been in the benefits space for over a decade. I really am here to help you all think through the change from group insurance to ICRA, because I know there's a lot of different nuances and implications to the employee experience. So we really want to make sure you feel informed and confident with that transition. And for a little bit of context about myself as well. At one point, I was in the HR seat and then worked at a broker and then moved to the vendor side. So I have a variety of different experiences that I can lean on as we talk through all of your options. So very nice to meet you. Good to meet you. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nThanks, Caitlin. Okay, so before I show you the updated quote, Joe and Cindy, because our eyes are going to start to bounce around, I just want to recap a few things, right? So, with an icra? And with that, there's a few key principles to keep in mind. The first, and I know some of this is review, But it's been a week or so since we've connected and this is all very different. So I just want to make sure we're on the same page. So the first kind of principle to keep in mind is, again, the idea that people's plans are priced based off their age and where they live, right? That is assumption number one that we have to abide by. And we come up with a strategy based off of that. Number two. Is we have to set a benchmark, right? And so we were looking at like, the lowest cost gold plan, the Gold one, the Gold 25, the 25th percent gold plan. And so once we have that benchmark, then we can come up with a contribution strategy towards that benchmark. Now, the thing that is a bit more difficult to map is obviously the idea of, hey, this is a defined contribution. It's not a defined benefit, right? So we're giving them this benchmark, Bye. If we give them a benchmark, let's say on the Gold One plan, the lowest cost gold plan, You may have employees who are like, oh, I can actually pick a lowest cost silver plan. That's fine for the coverage I need. And instead of paying, you know, I think your employees paying about $200 out of pocket, maybe they're paying $100 out of pocket now on this new, less expensive plan. So they're kind of putting money back into their pocket, right? So those are a few of the major dynamics. I just wanted to make sure we reviewed. See if you all had any questions on. And then, if not, I can jump into the the updated analysis. \nJMD:\nThat sounds familiar. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYeah, that was helpful. Okay, so let me talk through one more thing, and then I'll promise I'll I'll share my screen. So essentially, what I want to explain is like, what's the difference between what we were looking at last meeting versus this meeting? There's two things that have changed and the reason why I wanted us to have this call to look at a different approach here, which is one we created in the last few months, based off of having so many of these conversations. So we're really excited about it. But essentially, one of the things that was hard to understand on the last meeting was the dependent coverage and what an employee is paying out of pocket. Number two is we didn't have a good view into the disruption for specific employees. And by disruption, I mean, how much more or less are they going to be paying out of pocket. Compared to what they were paying today. So with that, Caitlin and I put together an updated analysis here. And let me go ahead and share my screen and walk you through this. Okay. Can everyone see the batch analysis page? All right, great. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nYou might want to zoom in, though. Sounds good. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nI'm not at my home station. I'm in our office. So I don't have it dialed in. Okay. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nMuch better. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nThat looks good. Yeah. Awesome. Okay, so you're going to see a few things that look familiar, right? The first is the benchmark, and then your current costs. So current costs are, you know, the same compared to what we looked at previously. We did add the renewal, which, Dan, thank you for letting me know. It's coming in closer at like 11.8%, right? So I just took your current costs and multiplied it by this number here. And then the second thing that did change as well, before I get into this new structure is. Thank you, Dan, and your team for looking at the dependent counts per employee. We did see that based off, and we talked about this on the last call, but we did see based off the last call, It seemed like we had more people with dependents than was actualized. So we went ahead and updated that as well. So what is different here? The big difference here is this employee contribution. So previously what we had was we had, like the gold one benchmark. right, which is staying here. But then we add like some percentage towards the employee and some percentage for dependents. Now, that's pretty hard to wrap your heads around and understand. And it can actually lead to inequality for employees. Because since it's a percentage, right, you're basing that based off someone's age. So, although you may be contributing 70% towards the employee, well, that 70%, the actual dollar amount is going to be higher out of pocket for older employees. And for us, our most important thing in terms of bringing you all to Thatch is you all understand the trade-offs between renewing as is and moving to Thatch. We want to make sure that if you were to move forward with us, you understand those. And it's a great experience for your employees. And so we don't want employees to be shocked at paying so much more on a monthly basis. So essentially, what we created is what we call flat cost share, which looks more like a group coverage model. Where what we do is we set. hey, based off of this benchmark, again, it's all based off this benchmark. That's how we have to work in the Icra space. An employee is going to be paying for just employee only coverage towards the Gold One plan. They're going to be paying about $210 out of pocket, right? Which I think right now you all are at like 209 or so that employees are paying out of pocket. So that's why I pick that number. And then, similarly, for a first dependent, they pay an additional $250 to have that first dependent covered on the Gold One plan. And then for additional dependents, up to three, because they're free, after that, they'd be paying $150 a month. So, again, the reason why we take this approach more often now that we've created it is one, because it's a little bit easier to understand compared to the percentage-based approach. Two is because we're essentially capping the amount of disruption that people can have, specifically the older employees. So that was a lot. There's a disruption portion I want to cover, too. Caitlin, saw you come off mute, so chime in. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nOne last thing to reiterate. On the cost share perspective, it is up to these thresholds listed. Someone may choose to buy not a gold one plan and choose a silver plan. So then the cost share would actually be less on the employee side. So what we are showing you here is your maximum liability. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYeah. And the inverse is true, right? If an employee comes in and they say, hey, you know, the Gold One plan isn't what I need. I actually need the median gold plan. Then, you know, they'd be paying more out of pocket, accordingly. But again, with more choice, especially with so many employees and being in California, back to the Kaisers in California. It should be, you know, a good experience for them, regardless. But yeah, great, great point, Caitlin. \nMitchell Andrews:\nSo, said another way from Joe's standpoint, and Cindy, you know, we'll get to you in just a second. But if Joe's trying to say, I really want to hone this down more, he can determine either what the employer contributes, right? So, the defined contribution on the employer side, or the defined contribution on the employee side. So if he wanted to pay less, he would raise that employee contribution, maybe on the 210 number, to 250. And, of course, that would be the offsetting expense on the net to the corporation. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nExactly. Yeah. Yeah. And so. \nMitchell Andrews:\nSo let me just hit the pause button for a moment. So, Joe, is you're trying to do your P&L here, right? If the numbers aren't working, which we know, they've been going up and to the right, and nobody gets excited about that. If we wanted to dial down that increasing number, You have the flexibility to play around with this spreadsheet while you look at what do we want the contributions to be. \nJMD:\nYeah, I think I understand that generally. Okay. \nMitchell Andrews:\nBecause we've always done a percentage share. And then backed into Cindy saying, how is this going to land on the employees, right? So, Cindy, I promised I'd bring you back into this, right? So, you're probably looking at these numbers and saying, okay, I'm going to have to eyeball these based on the actual plan design. Because there'll be a little bit of variation by state, right? But we're just working on the math equation right now. Does that make sense, Cindy? \nCindy Stein:\nYes. Okay. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nThank you, Mitchell. Well, well, said. So yeah, I'll give you, you know, Joe and Cindy, I'll give you access to this. But yeah, you can see like, for example, if I, you know, we said, hey, we want to increase this to. People are actually paying 250. Okay, then the cost is going to go down from, you know, 2.4 to 2.33. Right. So those are all the things that you want to keep in mind. Um, we do want to make sure you all are affordable right now, which we're at 99%. Yeah. 99% affordable based off this approach. So you can see, like, if I bump this a bit down to like maybe 150, you know, it goes, all allowances are affordable now, you know, like, Caitlin chime in, but in terms of 99% tile, like, we can hone that in and see who that employee is. It's probably one employee or so and look at what's specifically going on with them. Um, and, you know, make a recommendation base. Based off of that. \nJMD:\nAffordability based on Obamacare guidelines? Is that what you're talking about? \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYeah, ACA affordability, essentially. That's what we showed last year. \nDan Wilke:\nWe'd have to update it for your lowest rates, but it was $209 on the Kaiser plan, the maximum that you could charge. And it did go up from last year. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nWas 902% and next year is now 9.96%. So that's what that affordability percentage is really looking at. And then, in addition, there's also a unique Icra rule where the youngest member's allowance can't be more compared to the oldest member's allowance. And that oldest member's allowance can't be more than 3x that youngest member's allowance. So those are the two roles that are being factored in when you see that 99%. Of plans are all affordable. Yeah. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nAnd that, and that three by one rule is just based off of rating areas, right. Which are mostly zip codes, but essentially, for every rating area, it could be one zip codes. It could be multiple. If it's more rural areas, it's just looking at that rating area and saying, Hey, the oldest person can't get more than three. So what happens? Well, then the older, the younger people's allowances get bumped up. And you'll actually see that in action. When I get into the, the. Portion at the bottom here on the page of the employee cost impact, kind of disruption portion of it. \nDan Wilke:\nAnd then one other point to Caitlin's point that minimum affordability percentage is going up almost 1%, which is good news for you. It's probably about $20 then, based on what we had last year. So you might be in your head thinking of 230-ish around as the employee contribution that could potentially be used. And then the other question I had, Tom, Or just a reminder, I know we've gone through this once or twice, but the gold one, could you show what that plan design was again? Because, I think, was it the Gold 25? That's a little more like current plans. So I just want to keep that in mind, too. And if you could also flash up what the Gold 25 annual employer cost is. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nCaitlin, If we could just take that as an action item, if we could add the case study or the employee allowances in here so we can see what the benchmark plan is. Let me just tinker in the background. Yeah, you tinker and I'll pull up the other one. One second here. We need to add that to this template for this new, like I said, this is a new approach. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nSo you got an early release for you. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYeah, exactly. Second here. Let me find employee California. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nTom, I don't have, I'm a view owner only, so I can't actually change anything in the background. Thank you. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nThere's something else. One second, I'm lining up in the other one. Okay, so let me. To this. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nOkay, you can click into Allowances with the hyperlink. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nOkay, great. Okay, so you all will have access to this as well. But we actually have the benchmark plan here and it'll update based off whatever, you know, you, you change it to. Oh, it's not pulling in the actual benchmark, Caitlin. It's just showing the all plans page. That's okay. We can, I have it, I have it done. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nWe'll take it as an action item. Yeah. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nAnd regardless, the next step would likely be to do like a more custom approach at some of the other plans. Cause, like the thing about the benchmark as well, I'm going to pull it up, Dan, but the thing about the benchmark as well, right. Is it's like, it's kind of arbitrary? Because there could be, you know, a bit more expensive gold plan, that's actually a much better fit, but it's not like the Gold 25. It could be right in between. There could be a silver plan, for whatever reason. Is actually a better fit to, the individual markets, different than the, you know, group space, where, like, gold doesn't always mean it's better because they change the plan prices every single year in the individual market. Um, but the one, so the gold one that we had, was this for folks in California. It was this Kaiser plan, which again, was not a $0 deductible, it was a $22.50 deductible. But this would be the gold one. And then I'll need to confirm because I think something changed on my end. It was looking like the Gold 25 was a $0 deductible plan, Kaiser plan. Right now, it's pulling up a health net zero dollar deductible plan. So this is the one that's pulling up. But this should be pretty close to the Kaiser one. So Caitlin and I can just take that as an action item. And so I think that the thing to think about, right, is like, okay, well, you know, the Goal 25 may be the best fit if we're just looking at one specific plan. And we could do the goal 25 here and then increase the amount that people are paying out of pocket. Right. Or we could stay at the gold one and keep this amount a little bit flatter as well. And again, the hard thing about ICRA, which is why if we want to take a more custom approach, we can do. This. Is like, that's assuming people want this Kaiser plan. You may have some employees that want, you know, a blue cross, blue Shield, a Californian plan instead. Right. You may have people in your other states that want. Other carriers, right? So that's, that's, again, like, what's hard for us to estimate. But, you know, we have seen many such cases where maybe the benchmark is a little bit lower than what would be the actual plan benchmark, it's in the same vicinity. But if we have a good model here, where employees aren't paying so much more out of pocket, and they're getting more options, that can usually lead to, you know, good employee experience. While ensuring that, Um, you're hitting your cost goals, Joe. \nMitchell Andrews:\nSo, Cindy, when you look at all of these options, does it put a smile on your face? That people have more choices, or does it give you anxiety that people will panic that they've got too many choices? \nCindy Stein:\nI think they will appreciate limited options. I think they'll appreciate the ability to go out and try and find networks and their doctors, and they can make their own choices. But I think there's an educational factor between how do you read what a silver plan is versus a gold, versus a gold 25, etc. I think that's where there's going to be a challenge. And then Again, Tom, I think about truly, what is the selection or the ability for them to select in Arizona. When we think outside of California, what does Arizona look like? What does Texas look like? What does Florida look like? What are the options? That will be available to those individuals in states outside of California. \nMitchell Andrews:\nYeah, totally. Yeah, that's really, and I, you know, Cindy and Joe have been around me long enough, the others maybe not. But, you know, Cindy, I wasn't picking on you. I just, I think your opinion is important, because if they like options and you believe that options are better, the beauty of this plan, to the point that I made with Joe earlier. Is that you can say either here is going to be our defined contribution and that's it. Anything more you pay for, and it's just the inverse of the employee contributions here. Or, Cindy, because you're concerned that it's not going to be affordable when we do that, because the 58-year-old person, or the 62-year-old person is going to be spending a lot on top of whatever that defined contribution is, you can say. This is what you're going to have to pay and know that because you're getting a bit less expensive cost. On the younger singles, those older singles or older families, it's going to balance out. As it did, you know, hypothetically in the aggregate pool, which is otherwise your existing plan. Right. Because they put all those expenses together, added to a total, divide by headcount. That's how they do the breakout in a macro approach. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYeah. And Cindy, totally agree on like the, you know, hey, it's good to have choice, But so much of it is the change management and the implementation, and the way our technology works as well. I think the best story I can share, it's a customer of mine that just wrapped up their open enrollment last night. And they are a retail company as well, about 3000 employees located in. Mostly same states you are, but not in Florida. They're just on the West Coast. So they're retail stores, right? They have a very, very broad demographics of different employees. And we hit 99% of what they had previously enrolled for 2025, for 2026. So I think that goes to show like, hey, the people that need coverage, they're probably going to get coverage. But, of course, there was so much work to be done in terms of implementation, our product and really helping them understand this new way of. like, you have to take the onus to make the decision, But we need to support them and you all so that these people feel comfortable. \nMitchell Andrews:\nBut just two questions on that part of my interruption. I'm assuming this is somebody that Cindy could make a phone call to to talk about the experience. And number two, when you say 99%, is that... They went with Thatch last year and it was 99% this year, or it's this is the first year. And they were within 99% of where people were enrolling in the prior year. Yeah. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYes. On the reference, This is their first year. So I may want to give them a little bit post the open enrollment to breathe a little bit. \nMitchell Andrews:\nNext week's fine. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYeah, exactly. We'll do tomorrow. So, yes, we have many reference customers, and we always recommend you taking one or two of those calls. But yeah, Mitchell, to your point, they're a new Fash customer for 2026. So the 99% was how many enrolled they had in 2025 compared to 2026. So basically just sharing the idea, Cindy, which you don't want to see a major drop off. And they save 20% based off their renewal. So we were expecting it to come in even lower than that, because, quite frankly, they had to pull back the quality of benefits slightly, you know, a decent margin, because they just couldn't meet their financial goals. And they were getting a very large increase that, you know, they just couldn't, couldn't fathom. And that's where we were able to come in. So I would have expected that number, Mitchell, just based off them, pulling back the quality a little bit, to maybe be more than 85 or so percent, not 99. But I think that was one where the implementation went really well. And again, giving people more choice can often lead to really great outcomes for people. So a couple things I've heard, and then we can get to. The final piece of this is, so we'll look at whether it's in the sheet, whether it's something else, Caitlin, I will work on looking at the like. Like Goal 25, Goal 1, looking across different states and help you all understand what those benchmarks are, maybe even looking at a few like silver plans that could meet their needs as well. So that's something that we can do. But in terms of this new approach, and all the points we just discussed, any thoughts or questions, Joe or Cindy, from you on this? \nJMD:\nI have a number of questions, some of which we already talked about last call, I think, as well. But I think you guys mentioned that going from the old plan, and I think you just said it. For the example of the company that went live last night or whatever, that. Generally we have 700 employees, only 219 participate in the health care plans. But you said generally that we wouldn't expect to see it. Big jump up in that. You know, the one thought is that, hey, we're going to offer everybody this much money for health care. New people may want to participate. But you had said that your experience is that there's not that much of a bump in terms of the number of enrollees. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYeah. Yeah. It's really corner cases, I'd say, where there could be a major bump. So, you know, sometimes, Joe, for whatever reason, maybe it's the company's risk pool, like, Thatch is just extremely better option for them, right? Let's say if we're comparing kind of Apples to apples, maybe. Their current group plans are more in the silver range, like lower cost silver, but for whatever reason, we can get them on like a median gold plan on batch. If there's such a dramatic increase of the coverage they're providing, that can lead to a spike in enrollments. Usually it's, you know, nothing too crazy, like I'm talking 15 20 percent there. Um, but for you all, I think you would be much more in with the customer I mentioned, which is like, it's a similar quality of coverage that you're offering today. So if you're offering that similar quality of coverage, like, who are the people that are going to get health insurance? They're the people that want it, and they're the people that need it. And they don't want to go on their spouse's plan, or they don't have a spouse. Right. And for you all, you have so many employee only folks as well. Not sure of your demographics, if it's because their spouses, your plan's better than their spouses, or because they're just single folks. So because of those factors, Joe, I'd say it. I'd be pretty confident and stay pretty similar. But definitely something we can't guarantee, right? Just speaking to what my experience is and what our data tells us. \nJMD:\nBecause that could potentially unravel any economic savings if we start spending more. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYeah. And like I mentioned, too, you know, the first year of Icra is the hardest for two reasons. One, setting the right contribution strategy. Two, the change management. Right. For the second year, there's so much data that we have and that we'll share with you in our renewal process of. Like, what plans people actually picked, how many people had more money than they actually did. They had more money than the plan they actually picked. Right. So there's a lot of data that we can provide that can help you tweak things year over year to, like, hit your financial goals. Yeah. \nJMD:\nThat was one of my other questions is, what is the experience for the companies in subsequent years? I know this is relatively new. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYeah. \nJMD:\nA lot of history, but what can we expect? I mean, is this something where companies have decided we got to go back to a group plan or something because it wasn't working for them? \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYeah, I would love for Caitlin to chime in. She was very close on our renewal process this year, but there's a couple of points I can mention. I mean, I think, first and foremost, Joe, like, you know, the two benefits for you all here, for Cindy, your side, Joe, your side and your employee side. Is. Icra really gives you that flexibility in terms of budget, and it gives employees the flexibility of choice as well. So I think, just like, anecdotally, once you're in that world, it is hard to like, take that away from you. All from a financial perspective, and take away the optionality for employees. But. What we saw of this open enrollment was really, really amazing. But our net revenue retention, right, a key metric for us, was over 100% for the year. In the mid-market, kind of your type of company as well, in terms of the size, it was very, very strong. More SMB, you know, we sell to a lot of small businesses as well. A lot of those, like, you know. They go out of business or whatnot. Whereas in the mid market, it's very strong. But Kayla, I know you are closer to it as well. Not sure if you have any particular thoughts. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nYes, I have a few. So one piece on the renewal front is we will work with you on with preliminary rates. What our team did this year was we ingested information that was publicly available. Where, in individual markets, it works a little bit differently than group insurance, where, um, the carriers will file with the CMS preliminary rates, and then the insurance company and the government go back and forth and negotiate. To figure out the best rates for the upcoming year. Those are typically released and finalized by late October. So what we do is we use the public filing information available to be able to help have informed conversations as early as the carriers are filing information, knowing that you do want to have an informed fiscal decision. Like Tom mentioned before, one of the benefits with the individual market is your risk goal. Is distributed across the 25 million members in the individual market. So that's one of the factors that goes into the renewal conversations. What we really want to do is partner with you and the Plexus team on the best path forward. I also agree with Tom where the first year on Icra is the hardest. Because we're deciding your cost share. And then next year, we'll be able to reference your current cost strategy. What the potential new rates are, and then if the current cost strategy still works, or if we need to change things. What we do is we reference very similar, as you see here, current cost share, initial renewal based off of the preliminary rates, and then plan with you on a go-forward basis based off of your budget and your preference of if the rates come higher than a certain threshold. How we can reevaluate. So we really partner in lockstep with you and share information based off of people's actual enrollments and what metal tiers they end up falling into. We had some employers who actually knocked down going from gold one to silver 75, because they saw the majority of their employees were buying less rich plans. So it was a cost savings mechanism for the business. So we really partner to make sure you're making informed and backed space decisions. \nJMD:\nOkay, great. So as I'm looking at this chart that's on the screen, 2495 is our estimated renewal, if we stay with the current structure, and 2411 is kind of what you're estimating based on the Gold One template. Is that sort of correct in terms of what we're reading? \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYeah, the Gold one and then this as well, right? So we can tweak these numbers and, you know, not. To, Um, you know, if we want to say this is actually 200 for additional dependents, this this dollar amount's going to go down. Right now. There's going to be an impact to employees, which which we'll get to. \nJMD:\nBut um, but yeah, and then the tab that says, employee, whatever there's, you had one that was it. Is it? Listing each individual employee looks like it does right this one. JOE Yeah, so I think what we wanted to do, Cindy, is probably. Look at this in terms of a sampling of people in California that are on Kaiser that are single versus family. And then people outside that are on the UnitedHealthcare plans for Florida, Arizona, Texas, New Mexico, whatever. Just to kind of see what that really means. Because we looked at myself, we looked at Richard Kim. Both of us live outside of California on different plans, one in Arizona, one here in Florida, and then what the option would be in terms of a benchmark plan or option. The other thing you mentioned on pricing is based on the employee's age and where they live. Is there a distinction on the dependent side, or is it just based off the employee's age? \nTom Hemmingsen:\nIt's also based off the dependent's age as well. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nOne of the differences with Icra is that the distinction between child and spouse is not made the same way as it is in the group plan, where instead, it's the first dependent and second dependent. And that's based off the way that the Icra laws are written. So it's the count of dependents. \nJMD:\nSo how do we think about comparisons for those people that have family or lawyer and spouse? Yep. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nSo the proposed cost share, if someone has a spouse and a child enrolled, is that they'll buy up the first, the spouse first for $250. And then the first child is $150, and that's $150 per three dependents. And then it plateaus after that. Got it. \nJMD:\nOkay. And then what's Plexus' role in this structure going forward for the Plexus team? \nKaitlin Zidar:\nThey continue to be a consultant and advisor. \nJMD:\nAnd how does that work for you guys, Mitchell? How do you guys get paid? \nMitchell Andrews:\nSame way we get paid by UnitedHealthcare or Kaiser. The individual plans have compensation built into them, and that flows through Thatch and eventually back to us. \nJMD:\nAnd the Thatch, do you guys get paid outside of the platform fees that you're actually listed or from the plans? \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYeah, yeah. So from the plans, from the platform fees, and then, like Mitchell said, we have a revenue share agreement with our consultant partners. But, and I think outside of that, right, in terms of the implementation, we're just linking this for medical as well. So the ancillary is staying on the group chassis, right? So we really think that, hey, Avid, making us all lockstep, talking about implementation. Those are things that we really lean on our consultant partners to help us out with and to do it in a team-oriented way. \nJMD:\nOkay. Mitchell, what are the other companies that your firm has worked with in terms of adopting ICHRA plans, and what has their experience been? You don't have to give me names if it's confidential. \nMitchell Andrews:\nYeah, their experience has been essentially what was just explained to you. They were in a similar circumstance. So, you know, what I affectionately call the QSR space, retail, restaurant, hospitality. That's where, in my experience, this has resonated the most, where you do not have. Higher participation does cause some anti-selection issues, which has then caused some instability in renewals, right? I mean, we've worked together for what, the better part of five years, We've had some good renewals and we've had some really shitty renewals, right? I mean, if we're honest. And so they said, we want to get out of the Select the plan and try and make one size fits all. We just want to go to a platform that says, in these circumstances that I've been involved in, we want to go to defined contribution. We want to let employees by state, by city, by region, however you want to define it, make the choices with more options available. So that, you know, my word's not theirs. We can mask a bit of the defined contribution that we're giving to them with a lot more choices. So they feel like they can spend their dollars more wisely. And did that work? Yes. Why did it work? We went out of our way to communicate to people that this is different and here's the experience they're going to have. This is not, and I repeat, it is not, I go in and I have a couple of Kaiser options, a couple of UHC options, and I'm done. And I'm probably going to keep the same plan I had last year. This is... I've got quite a few options to select from. And I've got to pick my plan, design, and then I get to look at my network. \nJMD:\nAnd that can be tailored to, we don't have to offer them the entire world, right? \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYou do have to offer them all the plans that are available. So like California, that's going to be about 35 or so plans, depending where you are. Now, like, we showed you. In our product, we help you narrow that down, right? We ask them who their doctors are, how much they want to spend out of pocket. Do they have a carrier preference, right? There's different things that you can do. And then the other piece, which is, you know, very important too, is we have licensed support agents who will get on the phone with them, right? So they can schedule time with someone who is an advisor and they'll help them in a more personalized way, find the right plan, too. We see only about 15% of our employees that use thatch, our members as we call them, they only got 15% actually use that service, which I think speaks to our technology. But depending on the demographics of a company, those numbers can change as well. So do have to offer it all, But through the technology, through that support, and then also in the implementation process, there's more education we can do to help people understand like, what plan makes the most sense for them. \nMitchell Andrews:\nSo Joe, that's, and certainly Cindy, that is the key to the setup. You're going to have a lot of options. You can go through it on your own. There is a phone number that you can call, schedule an appointment. They will walk you through any questions that you have. \nJMD:\nAnd is that, I would think that that would give them some benchmark or comparison against what they have today? Because I can't tell you what I pay, and I don't know what all my deductibles are, visits or co-pays. I mean, I generally remember them as I go, but I think other employees would be in the same boat. They'd have to kind of be reminded of what they have today. Some will be very aware, some will be like, oh. \nMitchell Andrews:\nHow does that compare to what I'm doing now? Yeah, and so on the front end, asking people to go into their plan and pull that information so that they have it available. Will be important, really, before they actually go on the Fatch website. To use the technology in answering the questions, and certainly, if they're going to engage with a counselor to help walk them through. Because those are important questions in helping them select the right plan. \nJMD:\nI thought that you had shown us some things, Tom, in the last call. That were general comparisons to what people have today. Is that something that is part of that consultation, or do they have to gather their info and we have to re-educate them on what their coverages are? \nTom Hemmingsen:\nIt would be the latter. Yeah, they would need to gather that information. I mean, again, though, with employee communications, right? with. You could say like, hey, on average, people who are employee only are paying about $200 out of pocket today, right? That could be a part of the employee communications that we send out. So people are aware of that. And I agree with Mitchell's point. The other approach, though, is like, they're getting so many more options. We also don't want to, just like, limit people to saying, like, hey, find the plan that's most similar to what you're on today, because there could be a much better option out there, right? So. In terms of they have an idea of their budget, they can filter in that. I only want to see plans that cost me $150 a month. Show me those plans and then show me, you know, put my doctors in, see what carriers come up. But, you know, Kaiser is a really strong one for us, right? The company I referenced, the one that wrapped up open enrollment last night, about 75% of their employees are in California. And they had Kaiser before. So Kaiser, honestly, Kaiser in California makes this. A lot simpler. I know it's not your entire employee population, but having a good chunk of your employees there should simplify things quite a bit. Because most people, if they're Kaiser people, you're kind of, you know, lifelong Kaiser people, they bang that drum pretty hard. But they may change when they get to that. \nJMD:\nAnd I don't think we have, Cindy, 35 different plans in existence today. And if you break it down between employee versus family, versus employee and spouse or whatever, we could give them kind of a, Here's what plan you're in, and here's what your general costs are, co-pays, coverages, et cetera, that could at least remind them what they have today before they start the choices. We don't have 219 different plans. \nCindy Stein:\nNo, but, you know, the highlights for the majority of California are. Here's what you have in Kaiser. Here's what your deductible is. Here's what your copay is. Here's your pharmacy. \nJMD:\nAnd here's your monthly payment. \nCindy Stein:\nAnd this is what your out-of-pocket costs are. \nDan Wilke:\nThe majority just have one plan to communicate, a current plan. So that would make it a little bit simpler on the communication side. \nCindy Stein:\nAnd the same thing on UHC. \nDan Wilke:\nThere's only two. \nCindy Stein:\nWe've got, we've got. A plan. I don't know. \nDan Wilke:\nI think we took it down to one. Well, sorry. I'm seeing two because we kept that one open for, but any, any individual person only gets one plan to choose from. \nJMD:\nSo the cost may be different if they have a dependence or whatever, but. \nCindy Stein:\nBut Tom, I want to go back to the gold. One that was benchmarked against our current Kaiser plan. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYeah, I mean, I think like the Gold 25, quite frankly, and again, Caitlin, I can look at some of the other plans. But if we're like, mostly benchmarking on Kaiser for California, the Gold 25 is actually the best, best fit, I would say. But again, how does going to the gold one and offering more choice and then having this cost shared, like, how does that translate accordingly? That's that's something, again, we've seen, like, lowering the benchmark a bit. Is still going to provide a good employee experience because of the more options that you're providing. \nCindy Stein:\nAnd then on the on the end user side, as an employee who enrolls. And we do this every time we have a change, transitional care issues. Going from one doctor to another, I'm nine months pregnant and we change over April 1 and my baby is due on April 4th. Who assists with what, how do we handle those types of issues? The advocacy that our provider, the broker or the actual provider assists us with when we have those kinds of individual employee problems. What does that look like? Like, for the employee now? \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYeah. The first piece is really the upfront work we're going to do, potentially to make sure there's no major gaps in coverage for all of your employees. If there's specific employees you want us to look into, we're happy to take a custom approach there. And then ongoing, we are essentially your broker in terms of we're the ones... Enrolling you in the actual plans. Of course, you have the Plexus group and it's more of a team effort, like I said. So any like escalations to the carriers and things like that, those are things that we work through with you all. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nI would also add, we do have a team of licensed advisors who can meet with individuals on a one-on-one basis. To talk through transitions of care. And really make sure that we're being thoughtful with. For example, if someone's about to have a baby, that their gynecologist is in that work and really advising the plan selection in that process. \nJMD:\nAnd you said. The technology will show them which doctors may be in which networks, or which plans, so that they can say, OK, I want to make sure I can keep my doctor. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nYes, that's one of the first three things that people can see, and they can search their doctor directly. But then also if they want to talk through the transition as well, we do have that individual resource available. \nJMD:\nAnd in my case with my wife and daughter, do we have to pick one composite plan for the three of us, or do we get three different plan choices? How does that work? \nKaitlin Zidar:\nOur system is that you would be in one plan with the three of you. Does your daughter live elsewhere? Because I know sometimes that can be a piece of complexity if you have a child that's in college. \nJMD:\nNo, I'm old as hell, but my daughter is 13. But she lives at home still. My wife is somewhere between those two. She's not old as hell, but I am. \nMitchell Andrews:\nSay anything more, Joe. No compromising yourself. Exactly. \nJMD:\nNo, so. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nSo, yes, you'd be on a family plan, technically. \nJMD:\nOkay. So, that's probably simpler. And I may be confusing this issue, but this is different than the self-insured with the caps and administration and the IVNR and all that nonsense. \nMitchell Andrews:\nThese are fully insured plans, Joe. Yeah. Okay. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nYeah, these are fully insured plans. So, since we were talking about the renewal earlier, the carriers actually renew. Each of these plans on an individual basis. So the rates might change year over year, but then you as an individual can change plans if the price becomes not as attainable. \nMitchell Andrews:\nSo the example for the California plans, you know, this probably won't happen, but if Kaiser blew up and gave everybody a 22% rate increase, they're going to have options with UnitedHealthcare, with Cigna, with Aetna, with Blue Cross, with Anthem. They're going to have multiple different carriers to select from who, because they are operating on a different business platform, they're not the hospital slash payer insurance company. They are just the insurance company. And maybe they're in the cycle with all of the health systems that their rates are locked in. They might have better rates. Somebody might go to Aetna for a year. And then the following year, when they go through enrollment, Kaiser's gotten their stuff together and they're more competitive. They can switch and you're not having to switch the entire chassis, right? That's been the angst that you've had over the years, changing the chassis, upsetting people who were in Kaiser, right? Not liking the UHC renewal. And it was kind of an all or nothing game, to an extent. Now you're on a chassis that allows you to access. All of those individual markets, something that Kalen and Tom were trying to explain. The consistency when you've got a lot more lives on the individual chassis, and you've got significantly more. Government oversight on individual rates tends to make rates from year to year. Kind of go like this in the individual market versus in the group insurance market, it tends to go like this. \nJMD:\nIt never goes down, it flatlines and then goes up. \nMitchell Andrews:\nFair, fair. In your life cycle, certainly, And part of that is because there's 700 people eligible and we've got a little over 200, right? There's we've talked about these. \nJMD:\nYeah, there's split between plants and we can't get record. \nMitchell Andrews:\nWe don't have a lot of healthy premium in this group pool that you have. Right. And so you're just saying, look, this hasn't worked for me. That's why I made the comment. This is primarily been used for us. Where it's been attractive for our clients is in that QSR space, because this is not unusual. Where you've got a third of the population that's participating. Even in manufacturing, if it's not good, you're typically in that 50% to 60% range. Versus your more professional industries, you're typically 75% to 95% participation. So you're getting healthy premium with 30% premium, and you get a more consistent average, and you're just playing for a few of the outliers. Now you're losing that healthy premium, who's saying, I can get it from my spouse's plan somewhere else, less expensively. So that that cleaner premium is leaving you. \nJMD:\nAnd we have a lot of turnover, just like those other industries you mentioned, and probably in fewer retail or QSR. So throughout the year, we still have to offer everybody new each month, a whole bunch of same enrollment choices. I would think that that's where the technology makes it clean for them. \nMitchell Andrews:\nYes. Yeah. And that's. Again, if you look at Trump won when Icra was passed, it was a cool idea. Nobody had the platform. And so people were trying to adapt enrollment platforms to make it worse. But the billing, payment and collection was a real problem for the entire industry. Everybody was paused for a little while with the Biden administration. Are they going to kill this or not? When it was evident, they weren't. Companies like that said, OK, this is going to work. They're not going to kill it. We're going to start investing in the technology platforms to make this work. \nJMD:\nAnd we just make one monthly payment to you guys, or how does that work? Because we're not going to raise 35 million payments. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYeah, that's yeah, we covered this on a previous call, but we've covered a lot, a lot of ground. So thank you all for going through it. Yeah, like Mitchell said, a lot of the complexity and really where Thash differentiates ourselves is through our technology and us having more of a financial technology background, actually, Joe. And so one of the major problems is, okay, we're not just submitting a payment to one or two carriers, the UHC and Kaiser. We may be submitting payments to 30 different carriers across all different states, across our entire employee base. It's very dramatic. And so we've... Built direct integrations and built infrastructure on our end to ensure that payments happen when they're supposed to happen. So essentially for you, yeah, we bill you for the full premium amount and then the Thatcher platform fees. And then the employees portion goes through payroll, as is the case today. So that's all pre-tax. \nJMD:\nAnd then an employee's experience, currently, I'm on myUHC.com to look at my history. My claims, what's been paid, what I owe, that kind of thing. Each person would then enroll in whatever plan they selected and have similar access. It's not going to be through you guys for that, right? \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYeah, exactly. They can see some things through us, like their plan, design, you know, like if their enrollment has been actually made, right? We kind of give them like a tracker to see how things are trending there. But yeah, then they'd get emails from the insurance carrier like, hey, here's your login. In our system, we have a little checklist of like, look out for your member ID, and a few other things that employees see as well. \nJMD:\nAnd then we talked about in the case where an employee chooses a plan that's less costly than the amount that we're going to give them, that they would be able to utilize some of those dollars for other medical related activities. Dental or non-covered, medical or gym or whatever. How's that managed? Is that through their Thatch ID or access? \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYeah. Yep. I know we're at time, so I want to be respectful. I'll answer this and then we could chat through the next steps. But essentially, it's all managed through cash. Now, Joe, again, that's your all's decision as a company, whether you want to offer that. And we can talk more about the trade-offs of offering the ability to use leftover dollars on qualified medical expenses. So think of it more like an FSA. It expires at the end of the year. But yeah, we manage that. So they get a fetched Epic card that they can use and swipe. They can text us and ask if something's a qualified medical expense. And then again, we have that marketplace, which we've gone out and contracted with different kind of point solution companies, like in mental health, fitness products, et cetera. As long as it's qualified medical expense, then they could go in and discover new products and get discounts as well. \nJMD:\nAnd would we keep our same? Limited dental and vision products and plans the way they are structured now. Or would that be something that's thrown into this as well? \nTom Hemmingsen:\nNo, keep it, there's. There's no real reason to to switch those. It's like the medical is the the most important piece here. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nSo, uh, right, yep, actually, dental and vision are much more attractive. How you have it? \nJMD:\nYeah, yeah, okay, that's what I thought. Um, okay, um, Sydney, I think we talked about this and I don't know what this sounds like. You're going to provide us some version of this spreadsheet or ability. What I thought we would do is just pick a few employees in each of the different markets and see what the choices are now. But one other question I had is you were talking about, Caitlin, the published rate structures or plan structures. Is there a better time of year to adopt the NICRA? I mean, we're currently in April 1. We've had to push that in some prior years by a month or two, but is there a better renewal date for this kind of structure? \nKaitlin Zidar:\nFor year one, my understanding is you are looking at this for the April 1st effective date. Is that right? \nJMD:\nThat's right. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nSo I would just advise that you go in eyes wide open that the individual market does align to a January 1st effective date. So if you do, proceed with the April 1st. Then just know that you are looking at a short plan year temporarily. So deductibles and everything will reset come January 1st. And that's part of the upfront communication going in making this decision. \nJMD:\nAnd on a renewal following year, what's the involvement of the employees? I mean, what we don't really want to be dealing with is a lot of distraction in December when they're trying to sell jewelry. Trying to figure out their health care. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nYep, we try to make that as seamless as possible, where there is a bit of uncertainty with what we contain, as much as we can, with what we can control. We partner closely with the carriers, but then we also recognize that, like Mitchell was explaining earlier, there is the economics that we don't have full control on the carrier side. So if an individual is in a plan that is not renewing into the next year, we guide them to the closest match plan as what they currently are in, but that's where an employee does need to make that evaluation. Do I want a different carrier? Do I like this current carrier? And there is some attention required to make the most educated decision going into the following year. Generally speaking, we are seeing more carriers introducing plan options than removing plan options, But there is that moment of open enrollment. That is usually in the fall. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nAnd, and Joe, when is it, like, busiest for you? Is it December? Is it late November? \nJMD:\nThe next nine days. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nThe next nine days. Well, then, then, the answer can be pretty simple. It's like, we start your open enrollment 11-1 and it goes till 11-15, right? So you can, you can set whatever window you want from November 1st to December 15th. So given that you're renewing. There isn't a need to have to push that at all. So if we want to do 11-1 to 11-15, that's a very common open enrollment date for many of our customers, you know, in your space. And then also ones who, you know, want to get it done, like before the Thanksgiving holidays generally, as well. \nMitchell Andrews:\nTom, what's the latest date you've seen rates be published in the individual market? Yeah. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nI mean, this year, Mitchell, it was like October 30th. Like, it's, it's pretty, but what I can say is our... Team who is much smarter than I, the ones that are the data scientists and the people figuring all this stuff out, we got within a few percentage points of the projected rates, based off of the CMS filings and some other data sources as well. So we can't finalize it, but we can have those projections. And what I did with other customers was like, all right, we have those projections. And then as soon as they're finalized, we're getting on the phone, we're reviewing the renewal, we're getting it dialed in, and then we're launching from there. \nMitchell Andrews:\nYeah, because it's both CMS and the State Insurance commissioner. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYeah. \nMitchell Andrews:\nRight, because the states will push back. I mean, if you google this topic, Joe and Cindy, you'll see states like Vermont, who started at a 21 to 24 percent increase for individual rates. And that was the rage kind of in August and September. We knew it was coming down. Because that was the first foray, right? Hey, here's the car. You know, it's $10,000. Well, wait a minute. I really think it should be six. And the state's kind of banter back and forth. The State Insurance commission, as well as CMS, is looking at it. And it's a joint effort to try and get their final, This is what their increase will be on their individual book of business. Yeah. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nAnd then we also, like every year that goes by, Mitchell, we're getting more data as well to actually look at. like, all right, how did the initial CMS? Filings come in compared to what actually finalized. So we have multiple data sources we can look at to to come to a as accurate as as one as possible. \nMitchell Andrews:\nUm, Vermont and New Hampshire seem to be the outliers because small population, very liberal voting block and they want everything and don't worry about the cost. Yes, yes, political comment. It's just what happens in the state. So yeah, yeah, Okay. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nThere are a lot of factors at play. Yeah. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nBut so I think we can share this with you. I'll send a follow-up email. And then later today, after I'm off of a few meetings, and then, yeah, maybe, you know, we can plan to sync in the next few days, next week or something. I know it's coming up on the holidays and it's your all busy season. \nMitchell Andrews:\nYou'll have Joe's attention if you're buying some jewelry, Tom. So you might want to go on their website. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nI know I'm not, and I don't even have a Christmas gift for my wife yet. \nMitchell Andrews:\nUm, Joe can take care of you, Joe, you're in good company. \nJMD:\nJoe took care of me. \nMitchell Andrews:\nOnce before, that was in the old days. We actually walked into the vault. \nJMD:\nYeah, oh, that's when we were based in Chicago. \nMitchell Andrews:\nYes, if you're based in L.A. \nJMD:\nyou can walk into the vault. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nOh, I do see you have the I'm on the website right now. Yeah. \nMitchell Andrews:\nI mean, I'm looking at your watch. You can probably upgrade. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nI was, I was going to say, I saw the pre-owned Rolex was right there, But I don't think I'm going to get my wife. This is my wedding gift. \nMitchell Andrews:\nAnd I don't think I'm going to be able to put that watch in a trophy case and just say I want to see it all the time, but I want to wear something else. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nI know. Well, my well, now I have two sons. And so I've always been like, I want to pass that to them one day. So the first one, I was like, all right, I got it. Now I'm telling my wife. I'm like, well. The second already is going to get the short end of the stick and his birthday is on December 23rd. So he's already getting gyps. \nMitchell Andrews:\nYou've already bought the watch. Just pick out the one you want. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nExactly. Well, thank you all. Thank you all for taking the time. Yeah, I really appreciate it, Cindy and Joe. Great questions. Mitchell and Dan really, really appreciate the partnership. And I mean, you know, Cindy and Joe, it's. A lot of decisions to be made, but I love working with the Plexus group. And you got some great advisors there to help with the right strategy. And there's trade-offs to everything. \nJMD:\nYeah, I mean, last year we heard about this. We looked at it. We didn't really look at it in any kind of depth. And the question is, and the goal this year was to at least fully explore it and see whether or not we think it's a viable thing in terms of controlling costs. And still providing benefits to the employees. I think I'm getting more and more educated on whether or not I can say that, yes, we looked at it, and no, we don't want to do it, or yes, we want to do it. So it's been very helpful. I appreciate it. Of course. \nCindy Stein:\nThank you. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nOf course. \nMitchell Andrews:\nThank you guys. Everybody have a wonderful afternoon and we'll talk soon. Great. \nJMD:\nThank you. \nCindy Stein:\nTake care. \nDan Wilke:\nBye-bye. \n",

The opportunity appears unlikely to progress due to:\n- Higher costs than renewal ($1,063/month more expensive)\n- Limited network access (EPO only in NJ vs. current nationwide PPO)\n- Complexity with partnership owners needing separate coverage\n- Potential compliance issues with Aetna if splitting the group\n\nThe prospect team will likely stay with their current Aetna group plan despite the 42% renewal increase."

                "value": "Account Notes: Infinite Therapy Solutions - ICHRA Exploration and Implementation\n\n1. Key Points Discussed\n\n- Employer's Interest in ICHRA: The primary driver for exploring ICHRA is to manage significant 2026 renewal costs, with the current group plan facing a 42% increase. The employer aims to reduce healthcare costs and administrative workload, particularly due to the challenges of managing a seasonal workforce with high turnover.\n\n- Current Situation: The company currently offers a traditional group health insurance plan (Aetna POS 3000) with a 65% employer contribution. The workforce includes 73 employees, with only 13 currently enrolled in health benefits. The company faces administrative challenges due to frequent hiring and turnover.\n\n- ICHRA Solution Proposed: ICHRA allows employees to receive a pre-tax allowance to purchase individual plans. Two allowance models were discussed: a flat rate for all employees or a variable rate based on demographics.

Is Steve with you or is he calling in separately? \nMelissa:\nHe's going to call in separately. Okay. I don't see him here yet, though, so let me just text him and remind him. Okay. \nSamantha.Winter:\nNo worries. Leanne's going to jump on in a minute. She just needed to make a quick call. \nIsra Ahmed:\nHi, Samantha. \nSamantha.Winter:\nHi, Ezra. How are you? \nIsra Ahmed:\nI'm good. How are you? \nSamantha.Winter:\nGood. \nIsra Ahmed:\nHey, Melissa. Hi. How are you? I'm doing great. How are you? \nMelissa:\nI'm good. \nIsra Ahmed:\nAwesome. Nice to meet you both. Where are you both calling in from? \nSamantha.Winter:\nSo we're both in Jersey. Go ahead, Melissa. Sorry. \nMelissa:\nSorry, I was just going to say, I'm in Belvedere, New Jersey. And we're going to have to wrap our heads around an awful lot today. Yes, yes. Something that I'm really great at. \nSamantha.Winter:\nAnd then, Ezra, I'm calling in from the broker's office of Northern Jersey, Morristown area. \nIsra Ahmed:\nOkay, perfect. And then are you waiting for Steve as well? Yes, we are. \nSamantha.Winter:\nYep. And Leanne should be joining in a minute or two. She just needed to wrap up a call. \nIsra Ahmed:\nOkay. \nMelissa:\nYeah, Steve says he's getting on now. He just texted me back. \nSamantha.Winter:\nOkay, perfect. And Melissa, So we talked about doing a thatch slice for your hourly people, which I know Caroline confirmed we could do through thatch. We did take the question over to our rep at our general agent who works with Aetna, just to make sure there wouldn't be an issue. Aetna would have an issue, so we wouldn't be able to do Thatch and Aetna, but we do have this as an option. Okay. \nMelissa:\nSo we just found that out. So it would be completely thatch, then? Correct. \nSamantha.Winter:\nOkay. \nMelissa:\nSo we can't do both. Yeah, that is probably going to cause an issue, but let's just go through it anyway and see what it is. Exactly. This way you get in. Exactly. \nSamantha.Winter:\nThis way, we can make sure that you have an understanding of what that is, how it works if you decide to move this route. OK. \nMelissa:\nOK. OK. Steve, are you on? I'm here. \nIsra Ahmed:\nHey, Steve. \nSamantha.Winter:\nOK. \nMelissa:\nHello. How are you guys? \nIsra Ahmed:\nDoing great. Nice to meet you. \nSteve Vande Vrede:\nMe too. \nIsra Ahmed:\nAll right. Well, I'm Isra. I'm on the business team here at Tatch. You know, I got some information. Samantha sent me some information about you guys prior to the call. But, yeah, I would love to just hear from you guys as well. You know, what is prompting the surge? What are you hoping for when you look at other vendors for health benefits? And, yeah, anything that you would want to add? \nSamantha.Winter:\nSo, um. Isra, the reason why we were trying to look at this as an option is Aetna. AFA hit them with a 42% increase. So trying to see what we can do to help bring that down. \nIsra Ahmed:\nOkay. And it seems like there are 73 total employees, but only 13 are enrolled. Why is there such a low enrollment right now? \nMelissa:\nA lot of employees do not want to. To enroll in it. Um, we have a very unique workforce here, they don't want seasonal employees. \nIsra Ahmed:\nOkay, okay. So out of the 73, like, who are the how many are true full-time employees? I'm sorry, how many full-time? \nMelissa:\nOh, that's wait, let me just pull that up. I believe right now we're at 61. \nIsra Ahmed:\n61 full-time? Yeah, I believe so. Okay, and then you said there are some hourly and salaried employees. \nMelissa:\nThere are some salaries. \nSamantha.Winter:\nIt's heavier on the hourly employees as opposed to salary. Yeah, there's... Yeah, there's about five or six of us that are salary, six of us, I believe. \nIsra Ahmed:\nOkay. And so out of the 13 enrolled, there are some, like hourly and salaried people enrolled in this, right? Okay. And then I see everyone is on that same like POS 3000 deductible plan. And then you guys are covering about 90% across all the tiers. We do. \nMelissa:\nWait, you mean our 90? What is 90%? \nIsra Ahmed:\nYou covered 90% of the premium for all of the employees, correct? No, no, we do 65%. Okay, that's what I had on the census. So let me just... So it's 65% across all tiers? \nMelissa:\nThat's what we cover. Yeah, that's... That's our piece of it. \nIsra Ahmed:\nOkay. I don't know where that 90 came from. \nSamantha.Winter:\nYeah, I'm looking. I'm trying to pull up the census I sent over now. \nIsra Ahmed:\nAwesome. So essentially what we cover at Thatch, I can kind of chat about that, and then we can dive deeper into the specifics of how it can work for your company. So, can you guys see my screen, okay? \nSamantha.Winter:\nYes. \nMelissa:\nI'm having a tough time hearing you, and somehow I also just lost my Zoom. There it is. Okay. \nIsra Ahmed:\nOkay. Is your volume turned up all the way? \nMelissa:\nYeah, my volume is, I'm actually called in on my phone, so there's a little bit of a delay. But it's also that I'm a little bit my hearing is not that great. \nIsra Ahmed:\nSo, um, okay, I can. I can, uh, try to speak louder. Let me know if you need me to repeat anything. um, I can also repeat anything and double click into anything. But are you able to see my screen? Okay, okay, okay, um, can you see my my screen? Yeah. Okay, perfect. Awesome. So here at Thatch, our mission is to build a healthcare system that people love. And the way that we do that is by implementing the ICRA. So what the Icra stands for is called individual coverage HRA. It comes under the umbrella of HRAs, And it essentially allows you, as an employer to issue your employees a pre-tax healthcare stipend. That each of them can use to buy their own individual plans, which are all listed within our platform. So their individual medical, dental, vision. So, essentially, you are deciding what the costs are. You're going to decide what your costs are, what is the allowances that you're giving each of your employees, and then your employees use that allowance to pick a plan that meets their needs. So each of your employees are going to see local plans to them. So they'll pick a plan based on their own needs. No, two employees have to pick the same plan, and there are usually multiple different carriers, multiple different plan options. And then, with the funds, once employees use that, they can use it on their... Medical premium, They can use the leftover funds if they have any, and if you allow it, on things like co-pays, prescriptions, kind of like an FSA. So they can use it on other qualified medical expenses as well. So over here, this person got $750. She picked a plan that was $500. The remaining $250 works like an FSA, and it goes on to attach debit card that they can use physically or virtually. Another place that they can use their leftover funds on is the Tatch Marketplace. So the Tatch marketplace gives your employees access to a bunch of health and wellness services that we partner with. So things like fertility benefits, sleep, mental health, you know, any tests, any equipment, whatever that may be, They can use their funds directly on the Tatch marketplace to get that as well. Any questions that are coming up here on the quick overview? \nMelissa:\nNot yet. I'm just kind of gathering the understanding of it. Yeah, so this model... The biggest problem... Go ahead, you can keep going, and then I'll ask questions at the end. No, no, you can ask questions as we go. Yeah, so the reason I'm saying that is you might actually answer my questions before I... You know what I mean? As you're going through it, you might already answer my questions, because... Basically, my biggest concern is how it would be handled, too. We have a large turnover of employees because our work is very seasonal. And so getting someone on, then getting them off again, figuring out how much is left on this health care budget, it might become a concern for us. We don't have, like our employees, that we that we turn over aren't considered seasonal or temporary because of the length of time that they work. But they don't day year round, and we don't necessarily hire them back every single year. Sometimes it's a whole different batch of people and, you know, older ones, interspersed. So that's where, like, we're basically a small business with a lot of people. All of a sudden, you know what I mean? Yeah. \nIsra Ahmed:\nSo those employees that are turning over, are they utilizing the health benefit? \nMelissa:\nRight now, they don't usually sign up for it. You know, right now, nobody has really been that interested in having it. I think because they probably feel it's as much as a hassle to get on and get off again, you know, and then they're dealing with cobra or not being on COBRA, you know, it's, it's just, but it's just, it's just like the keeping up piece of it. You know, at this point, we just get a sign form, they don't want it, and then we're done, you know? Yeah. But like I said, go ahead and explain the whole. Program. And then we can, we can go through like the those types of questions, because that's really my biggest concern is how it gets handled. \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah, no, for sure, and thanks for bringing that up, and I will get to like how that is handled. Um, but yeah, so essentially on, uh. With this model, the plans are priced solely based on where employees live, how old they are, and the number of their dependents. So, um, employees are, uh, seeing plans and prices local to them, and prices based on their demographics. So each of our employees are going to see different plans and prices. So now, because the plans prices, they vary based on each person's demographic, there are two ways that you could do allowances. So one, you could either give everyone the same flat allowance across the board, you can say everyone gets $900, like in this example. But if you were to give everyone the same allowance across the board. You know, younger people would be able to do a lot more with that than older people. People in cheaper states, let's say, would be able to do a lot more with that than people in more expensive states. So this would create unequal purchasing powers. However, you're still allowed to do that. But then another way to do allowances is to give different allowances to each person towards a certain level plan. And we typically start with the current plan that you're on. We try to map that to a similar level. Plan on patch and say, hey, how much would you have to offer each person to give them this level of coverage? Now, the level of coverage, you can decide what that benchmark is. The whole beauty of the Icra is that you can decide where the, you know, where this lies. Does that make sense? \nMelissa:\nYeah. Yeah, that makes sense. \nIsra Ahmed:\nAll right. So, yeah. So the contributions are up to you and there are two ways that you can do that. And then Tatch. Tatch is the only end-to-end third-party administrator in the space. So we automate everything from premium payments, enrollments, compliance, payroll deductions, and so forth. So the only thing that you guys have to do as the employers are, um, are. You know, decide those allowances, which we help you do. And the only thing your employees have to do are pick their plans. Everything else is handled by us. So, you know, we'll take a look at, like, when the compliance documents are ready and all of that, when payroll deductions are needed to happen, we'll do all of that there. Okay. And then this slide is kind of just comparing group plans to Icarus. So, you know, with the current coverage that you're offering today, you have to decide on the plan for your team. Everyone is on that same plan, regardless of their needs, regardless of their, you know, their doctors being in network or not. And then you're kind of left dealing with renewals and these increasing costs. With group plans, the costs also increase 15 to 35 percent year over year. Whereas with the ICRA, the plans, prices, they kind of stay at a plateau. Because there are so many different options, some might increase, some might decrease, but they still don't increase the way that group plans do. And then the other thing is, with this model, you don't have to pick a plan for your team. Each of your employees picks a plan based on their needs, your setting and budget, based on your appetite. And so you get to control costs while offering flexibility and choice to your team. And then this slide kind of walks through, like. How, you know, when you're offering a group plan, you're offering one plan, you have to pick. Like the most expensive, national level kind of PPO plan that encompasses everyone's needs. And then when you move to the Icra model, you move to multiple different carriers, multiple different plans. And a lot of employees end up picking plans that meet their needs, but are not the most expensive PPOs. You know, they might, they might pick cheaper plans. All right. Any other questions? \nMelissa:\nNo, I mean, it seems pretty straightforward. So they would then enroll in, like your website, to figure out what plan they would be going to, or they would just go to, like the state that they're in? Yeah, no. \nIsra Ahmed:\nSo they would go to our, the plans are all listed within TAC, so they don't have to go to any other like government website or anything. They just do it within TAC. And, and then, yeah, their plans, and, and then that's it. So, to answer your question about the seasonal employees now, when your employees enroll in plans and then let's say they are leaving mid year, all you have to do is just off board them within touch. Once they're off boarded, then you know they're good to go. And then, yeah, and then if they join again next year, though, you can adjust that next year. \nMelissa:\nSo when you say off-boarding... Okay, and then what happens... \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nSorry, go ahead. Sorry, Melissa, it's Leanne. I was going to say, when you say off-boarding, they can continue their plan direct with the carrier. They're just not part of the group's Icra anymore. \nIsra Ahmed:\nExactly, yeah. So because these are individual plans, they're tied to the individual, so they still have the plan. They're just going to stop receiving the funding towards it. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nOkay. I'm sorry, Melissa, I cut you off, too. What was your question? You actually just asked the question that I was going to, so that's perfect. Our minds work alike. \nSamantha.Winter:\nYeah. \nMelissa:\nSo now the other question I have, though, is what happens if someone decides not to enroll? Are we still liable for setting up this HRA card for them? Or if they just say, no, they don't want to do it at all, we just don't get involved with them and nothing goes into their account? \nIsra Ahmed:\nNo, so you just send invites to everyone. If people don't want to enroll in this, they can just ignore that invite. They don't have to do anything, and you don't have to do anything. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nThey don't get anything. \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah, you're only funding the people that are enrolling in a plan. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nAnd I think we clarified before, Sam, just to touch on, and you guys might have touched on this before I joined. I apologize. I was late. For Mathatch perspective, the seasonal employee, like, we can carve out where. Thatch is okay with a certain class of employees being here with Thatch. And then let's say salaried employees are on a group plan that stays in existence. And that works in the Thatch system model for an ICRA? \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah, you can have hourly employees on the Icra and salaried employees on a group plan. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nOkay. For Steve and Melissa, Aetna has a slightly different take on it. They, and we didn't ask about you guys specifically. And we've... Technically are through the renewal, so to speak. So, you know, we're not filling out certification paperwork right now, but they still require 20% participation. So we potentially could run into an issue next year with them filling out certain to make that we're eligible. That they would find fault with our having our group split like this. However, so they took the group to begin with. And they've seen the whole census and know that we, you know, we're already, there's already a load for participation. So I don't think it's the end of the world, But it could be something, an issue that we run into with next year's renewal, going through certification. \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah. And one thing I'll call out about the ICRA, like when you do create that class, there needs to be at least 10 people on the Icra as well. So there is... If when you create a class there is a minimum participation requirement, if there are no classes, then there isn't a minimum participation. But if you're creating a class, then there needs to be at least 10 hourly people that are enrolling in the graph. Enrolling, not even just offering actually enrolling. \nSamantha.Winter:\nOkay, that's news to us. Okay, so what, actually, what happens if we don't have 10 people that want to enroll in it? \nMelissa:\nWhat if we have nine? There's nothing like Wacky like that. Does it just not get offered at all at that point. \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah, it would not, like, it wouldn't be compliant. Then you would face some compliance issues. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nSo that's not a, that is like, an icra rule, not necessarily a thatch rule? \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah, that's an icra rule. Okay. \nSamantha.Winter:\nOkay. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nAnd that's only a carve-out, whereas if the whole group moved over, it's, yeah, okay. \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah, that's only if you're doing the full-time, part-time carve-out with the group plan. So that. Minimum participation comes into play. If you're also offering your group alongside an ICRA, then there needs to be at least 10 people on the ICRA. Okay. Okay. \nMelissa:\nNow, another quick question is there's a minimum wage type requirement for making the insurance affordable. Does this bypass that completely with the allowance for the HRA, or is this something we still have to take into consideration. \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah, so you do have to offer minimum, affordable coverage, even with the ICRA. It is different than how it's done on group. It has its own affordability requirements, and we check for that when we're setting those allowances. And I have created a quote for you with the 12 enrolled employees, and we can walk through that. But yeah. Are there any other questions, or should I kind of talk through the quote? \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nI think we can talk through the quote. Yeah. All right. \nIsra Ahmed:\nSo this is what the quote looks like here. So, all right. Just to confirm one thing, the lowest salary across your group is. 23,400. \nSamantha.Winter:\nSo Melissa, just so, you know, when I, um, I took the census that you had provided with everyone's hourly, and then I took that and multiplied it by 25 hours a week and 52 weeks a year, just to give a minimum, minimum number. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nSo it could be higher than that. \nSamantha.Winter:\nIt could be higher than this. \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah, but we- that's fair, so that is, that's actually going to determine the quote and like, determine affordability piece. So what? What is the lowest salary across all of your full-time employees? \nMelissa:\nThe lowest is 15 an hour, so that's our, that's our, um, like, our lowest hourly pay is we start everybody at 15 an hour. Okay, so that's 31, 200, that's our, that's our, like, lowest level employer. You know, we have a bunch of laborers here that... Basically where they're at and it goes up from there. \nIsra Ahmed:\nOkay, so that's different than what I have. So let me just update that. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nI was going to say, can you adjust that on the fly? \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah, just give me one second. \nMelissa:\nAnd also, just so, you know, Steve lost his connection, so I don't know if he's going to try to get back on or if he's just going to politely exit here. I'm not sure what's going on with his computer downstairs. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nThat's okay. All right, she's suggesting this. \nIsra Ahmed:\nAll right, give me one second. I'm just adjusting something here. Sure, take your time. All right, so this is what the quote looks like here. So what you're seeing on this side is the benchmark. So, you know, I mentioned the plans, prices, they vary based on each person's ZiP code, age, and dependent count. So each of your employees are going to different prices for their plans. And so we use a benchmark level plan to ensure that everyone is getting coverage towards similar level plan. And so these what you can decide here is like, OK, bronze, level plan, silver, gold. And then these numbers are that specific. The first percentile is the cheapest bronze, silver or gold plan. The hundredth percentile is the most expensive bronze, silver or gold plan. Now, for you guys, I mapped the current plan that you guys are on today, the POS 3000. And that came to a 50th percentile silver. And we can talk more about, like, what plan it maps to. We try to match it as close as possible. Obviously, individual plans are going to be different than group plans. There may not be an exact match, but we try to match it as close as possible in the plan design. And then I've applied the 65% cost sharing across the board here. I had to increase the employer contribution to 67% for the employees. Because as you see, once I go to 65%, it tells me that. Two employees are receiving an unaffordable allowance. So we just have to adjust. To ensure that everyone is coming out affordable with this. \nMelissa:\nSo the other thing that two employees that just showed up there, if you go back to that 65% where it says two employees, those two employees are drivers. And while they make hourly wages, they also get paid flat. And I had no way of putting in those flats. So certain runs that they do so. We have tractor trailers. And certain runs we do, we pay them a flat rate of, you know, X amount of dollars, you know, a day for this run. So we don't, I did not actually in this whole calculation with the hours, calculate those two in. So I don't think that they would be outside of that because I think their flat rates would actually bring those two particular people up. Increase them. \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah, but we take, we take the lowest salary, and we use that as affordability. To take a more conservative approach, because if you hire someone that is a similar age as these people. But with that salary, we just want to ensure they're also being covered. So we just take the lowest salary across the board. Which you told me was 15 an hour. So then I just multiplied that by 2080 and then that gave me 31,200 as your minimum salary. Okay, so that's what we're basing the affordability off of, and that's in an effort to guarantee it's affordable. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nAnd not. look, you're not, because you can't look at this every month, at every individual person. Is that? \nIsra Ahmed:\nExactly. Yeah. So it's to guarantee that if you hire someone else that, you know, is maybe could be more, could be older than these people, that they're also getting an affordable allowance. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nOkay. \nIsra Ahmed:\nSo yeah, and then over here in the middle, you're seeing that different. Each of your employees are getting a different allowance based on their demographics. So, like Ronald, for example, is 54 with zero dependents would get 688. But then James, who's 57, is getting 785. So, accounting for that little bit of an age difference. Most of your employees are kind of like in the above 45 range. And then, yeah, and then the people with dependents will get some more there and so forth. Now, over here, it shows that your current spend is $10,357 on health benefits. Is that correct? You said you offer something on the side as well. So is this accurate? Does this sound accurate to what you guys would be spending? Not today, sorry. It's close. Monthly, it's... \nMelissa:\nOh, I'm talking about the total. Okay, um, wait one second, let me just, Yeah, I'm sorry. \nIsra Ahmed:\nThese are renewal numbers, so what you would be paying if you were to renew with your current group plan, it would be 10, 300. \nMelissa:\nYeah, let me just, Oh, I see, okay, your cost, yeah, so the employer portion probably close enough. Yeah, yeah. \nIsra Ahmed:\nSo, uh, that's what the like your renewal is coming at. And um, you know, when I ran this benchmark at, um, what? What? We think would be one affordable but also similar, it is coming a little higher than your, uh, renewal. So that's one thing to note there. Okay, I'm not seeing cost savings right off the bat here. Yeah, um, no. \nMelissa:\nAnd just to be, just to be clear, the coverage that we're talking about in Thatch is only for the state that the person is in. Like, it's not nationwide. is there anything that's nationwide? \nIsra Ahmed:\nOh, okay. No. So that depends. So, for example, in Pennsylvania, there are PPO plans. So PPO plans are nationwide plans. So people in Pennsylvania have 38 options to pick, like nationwide plans, essentially. But people in New Jersey only have EPO options, and these do not provide network coverage. So that's, yeah, another call out there. Okay. \nMelissa:\nYeah. So it's not exactly the same at that point because we're losing the... Unfortunately, every one of my doctors is in Pennsylvania and I live in New Jersey. It's like a direct concern for me. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nBut, I mean, and just New Jersey is small, and we have access to, like, direct access to Philadelphia and New York. So it's always it stinks that the individual New Jersey market only has EPos, because then anyone in the individual market is stuck, essentially not being able to seek care in, like, two of the largest markets. It's like, if something... Happened to you and you needed care, chances are you're going to go to New York to see a specialist versus New Jersey. Exactly. \nMelissa:\nYeah, no, I totally understand. \nIsra Ahmed:\nSo, yeah, you know, for your group personally, like, I don't think this is that compelling, given there aren't that much cost savings and there are only EPO options. So yeah, I can send this to you if you guys want to take a look, but I think staying probably on that group option might be better. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nSo this is, so we're looking at the rates, it's actually 42, our renewal is 42%. So these individual rates are just right up there with that renewal, basically, is what you're saying. Yeah. Yeah. \nIsra Ahmed:\nSo in some states, the individual rates, you know, might not be as competitive. It seems like in New Jersey, it's not as competitive. But then the other states, they perform really, really well. And it also just depends on, like the type of group plan you have, other factors as well. This is Also, because these plans are age-banded, like, typically, when there's a group that has mostly people above 45, it can tend to be more expensive. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nYeah. Okay. \nSamantha.Winter:\nOkay. \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah, if you don't mind sharing that with me, your quote, that would be awesome, because then I can go over it with my supervisor, since he kind of cut out on us. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nYeah. \nMelissa:\nI don't know what's going on down there with his connection, but apparently he was not able to get back on. \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah, for sure. Yeah, I'll send it to you guys. And then you'll also be able to. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nWhen you send it, is it a link to the proposal, from what I recall? And then we can kind of play around with it, or. \nIsra Ahmed:\nOK, yeah. So you'll get, you'll get a link to this. It'll come here and then you can click on Edit and then you can also play around with these. And click into any employee as well, view the plans and breakdown and all of that. Another thing I want to ask, like, how is the company taxed? \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nI mean, as a C corp, or as an R is Steve, are they s corp owners? \nMelissa:\nOh, we're in, we're in, we're in LLC. Mike and Steve, it's a LLC partnership. \nIsra Ahmed:\nOh, partnership. And then, who are the owners of the partnership? \nMelissa:\nMichael Vandevried and Stephen VandeVried. \nIsra Ahmed:\nOkay, yeah. So partnership owners are also not eligible for the ICRA, so they wouldn't be able to use TATCH. They would just have to go to the marketplace to pick their plans up, as opposed to picking their plans on TATCH. So that's another thing to keep in mind. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nOkay. \nMelissa:\nSo if they were to go, so if we were to, let me just clarify that, if we were to go entirely, our entire group to TATCH, they would have to go independently and get their own insurance. As like a two-person group somewhere else? \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nWe would assist them and they would be buying individual coverage. But it just couldn't be in the shell of the Icra because of how they're taxed, because they're the owners. Yeah. They're accessing the same plans, it's not as easy because it's not through this system. \nMelissa:\nDoes that generally tend to make their rates more expensive at that point? \nIsra Ahmed:\nNo, individual plans are rated, all rated on the same way. So they're all rated based on ZIP code, age, independent count. Okay. Yeah. So the plans and prices are the same. They just can't pick it on the patch platform. Because we show the off-exchange versions of those plans, which these off-exchange plans are eligible for, that pre-tax deduction. And partnership owners receive... A pre-tax, uh, pre-tax benefits from the government already, so the I.R.S sees that as double dipping into pre-tax benefits. \nMelissa:\nOkay, gotcha, can you just go back real quick? \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nFor me? I mean, I'm going to see it on my own. But that summary where it says that the thatch price, the, Yeah, the $20,534. \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah, I would focus more on the total employer cost. The total healthcare spend that varies, that depends on, like, what plans employees pick, right? So the employees portion depends on the plan they pick from all of the like 50 something options they have. So I wouldn't focus too much on the total healthcare spend. I would just look at the total employer cost. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nOkay. \nIsra Ahmed:\nAnd the total employer cost is, yeah, also assuming that all employees are going to, like, max out their allowance. Like, for example, Daniel. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nFor the total current cost, like, where do you have that loaded? If we wanted to see to make sure, like. \nIsra Ahmed:\nIt's right here, the one that says currently. So this is, I took the renewal numbers as the current. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nOkay. \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah. \nMelissa:\nAnd how many total employees are, is it just the 12 that are showing there? Is there, so this basis is just on who is currently enrolled? \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah, the 12 enrolled employees, yeah. Okay. And then, Leanne, I don't have your email, but I can send this to you as well. If you share your email with me, if you could, drop it in the chat. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nYeah, I will drop that in the chat. Okay. I can't spell my name today. That's not good, Leigh. Yeah, this was helpful. I look forward to seeing just the link. So we can take a look closer at this and compare it to the renewal to see if it's viable. At the outset, it doesn't seem. Because of the New Jersey access, I wish everybody was in Pennsylvania, but we can talk more about it. \nSamantha.Winter:\nYeah. \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah, Pennsylvania is pretty good on here. But, yeah, I'll send this. I've sent this to all of you guys. So just feel free to reach out if you have any questions. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nOkay. \nSamantha.Winter:\nOkay. Perfect. Thank you. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nOkay. \nMelissa:\nGreat. Thank you very much. \nSamantha.Winter:\nThank you. Isra, can you stay on for just a minute? \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah, sure. Okay. \nSamantha.Winter:\nOkay. Melissa, I just had to ask her a question about a different group. \nMelissa:\nOkay, sure. No problem. All right. Thank you so much. Thank you. \nLeighAnn.Panas:\nI have to jump for another call too, but we'll connect Sam. \nIsra Ahmed:\nThank you. \nSamantha.Winter:\nOkay. So Isra, um, so, so Caroline was messaging me about, um, another group, you know, in the two to 50 segment, um, the owners, it's the same thing. They're an LLP, so they can't enroll in the Thash platform. I asked her to get me the name of someone who could assist her, and she never did. Do you have anyone? She said that there were thatch brokers. \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah, that can assist. \nSamantha.Winter:\nYes. \nIsra Ahmed:\nYeah, yeah, for sure. Here, let me. \nSamantha.Winter:\nThank you. Just because the owner followed up with me a little while ago, asking for the name of someone. So I know. Yeah. \nIsra Ahmed:\nSo they're already enrolled on thatch? \nSamantha.Winter:\nThey're not already. The group is in thatch. The owners. When we met with Caroline, Caroline didn't ask how the group was taxed. So we didn't know any of that until after everyone else was put on and had their invite sent. Okay. Yeah. \nIsra Ahmed:\nI forgot that. Yeah. So I just dropped the link in the chat. So this is what owners can use to enroll, to get some help to enroll in like a plan. Yeah. \nSamantha.Winter:\nPerfect. Thank you so much. I appreciate that. \nIsra Ahmed:\nOf course. Yeah, no worries. Yeah. Well, I hope you have a good day. I'm sorry we couldn't help out much with this group. Some groups, they perform well. Some groups, they don't. This one, there wasn't a ton of cost savings here, But I'm looking forward to working with you in the future on any other opportunities, hopefully with better cost savings.

KEY POINTS DISCUSSED:\n\nNote: The conversation did not explicitly discuss ICHRA or 2026 renewal cost management. Instead, the discussion focused on configuring Thatch benefits with a flat allowance structure.\n\nBenefits Structure Clarified:\n- Employer is providing a flat allowance of approximately $2,000-$2,100 per month for employee + family coverage\n- Allowance breakdown: $500 for employee, $500 for first dependent (spouse), $500 per additional dependent\n- Total family allowance aggregates and applies to the chosen family plan premium (not limited to individual employee portion)\n- Unused allowance funds roll over month-to-month but expire December 31st of each calendar year\n- Employer is providing 100% premium coverage, eliminating employee payroll deductions\n\nPayroll Integration:\n- Payroll system: Deal (already synced with Thatch)\n- Payroll schedule: Semi-monthly (15th and 30th/31st)\n- First payroll date: January 30, 2026 (originally planned for January 1st but delayed)\n- No payroll deduction setup required since employer covers 100% of premiums\n\n2.

Come on. Okay, I think they're connected. You can hear me all, right? Yeah, can you hear me? I can hear you, fine. Let me just see if I can get them in my ears. It's not finding it. Okay, that's not a big deal. Whatever, that's fine. Okay, well, we'll just do that. I just don't want to bother anyone else, but I think it's okay. All right, how are you doing? \nBrian Williams:\nDoing good. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nGreat. Doing well. Yeah, not too bad. It's a busy time. But yeah, I'm happy to help figure out what we've got going on here. I just pulled up your account and the email I sent you. So just to remind both of us what we're looking at. So, as far as timeline, we got a little bit more time. But I guess wondering also if you'd want me to create that customized quote so you can have. Something that's 100% covered. Do you want me to do that for you? \nBrian Williams:\nYeah. So what it sounds like, and just to make sure I understand. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nSure. \nBrian Williams:\nSo when I'm on the section that says same dollar amount for everyone, and then I put in a default allowance, if I have the employee allowance, let's say $500. And let's say if there's three dependents, $500, so $2,000. If the employee portion of the premium is, let's say, $1,000, only $500 would be covered? Is that right? \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nNo. The total, so if you have, like, right, the breakdown for the employee, the first dependent, which would be the spouse, and then additional dependents for any other, I mean, kids, so other dependents, that total cost, total allowance that you provide, all of that will go towards whatever family plan. The employee chooses so. Just because you only give the employee 500 to cover what their costs would be if they were just a single individual, doesn't mean only 500 will go to that plan. So that total 2000 you just mentioned of everyone's allowance is added up within the family, will still be applied to the premium that the employee chooses for the family. Does that make sense? \nBrian Williams:\nOkay, great, yeah, so so then it sounds like what I have set up right now with. I put allowance by state and I just saw Washington. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nYep. \nBrian Williams:\nThat covers 2000, or like, basically $2,100. So from what we've seen on what the plans would cost, plus any remaining, that should reasonably cover, you know, most months. Unless there's some kind of like surgery or emergency or something. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nRight, right. Exactly. \nBrian Williams:\nAnd does that carry over, too? So let's say if there's $500 a month extra, out. If we don't use that, does that mean the next month there's $1,000? \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nExactly. So it'll cover, it'll roll over month to month. It expires at the end of the calendar year. So they can accrue that, those dollars throughout the 2026 calendar year and around, you know, December 31st is more of a summer 31st. By that time, they would need to use any and all funds before everything resets for 2027. \nBrian Williams:\nOkay, great. So then I think the way I have it set now works. Okay. So we got that covered. I found out from Deal Is looks like payroll is going to start on the 16th and then is the 30th. So if we sign up for benefits, I'm assuming, because, you know, technically, Barbara will be an employee, technically starting the 16th. Um, will benefits be retroactive to the first or is it the start date? \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nGood question. So it would. The benefits are active the first of every month. So if you have her enroll in a plan in the next week, then her benefits will start starting January 1st. Does she need benefits starting January 1st, or does she have benefits until maybe January 31st? Do you know what her status is there? \nBrian Williams:\nYeah, we're covered on our current benefits until the end of Feb, oh, the end of February, yeah. So we were just just trying to time and so I'm assuming then it's okay. She can sign up for benefits, even though she's technically not a payroll employee? \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nLet's see. Because she would become a W-2 employee starting January 16th. Is that right? \nBrian Williams:\nYeah. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nThat's a good question. My gut is telling me, no, and she's currently a contractor, right? Or is she not like, enrolled? Like, she's not an employee at all right now. \nBrian Williams:\nI think, yeah, like, technically, no, she's not an employee. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nRight. I'll ask my team. I guess the thing I'm thinking is like, if she has coverage for January anyway, then. What I would probably do or recommend is have her coverage. Start date Start for either February 1st or March 1st. If you have, if she has coverage through the end of February and you want to push that out, push that out. To have her be covered through Fatch on March 1st, that's fine, too. That's what I'm kind of thinking, like, she doesn't have to choose a plan right now to have January 1st or February 1st coverage if she's covered through another plan through the end of February. Okay. \nBrian Williams:\nOkay. Yeah. I'll talk to her and we'll decide. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nYeah. Yeah. I guess. Let me know if you want to offer her coverage for January, like for when she's starting January 16th, and the coverage would start January 1st. I don't know if that, I don't know a hundred percent if that's allowed, if she's technically not on payroll for two of the weeks. I don't know. \nBrian Williams:\nYeah. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nBut I could also find that out if you want, like ahead of time. Do you want me to ask that question now, if you think that might be a possibility? \nBrian Williams:\nYou know, I'm not sure if the two weeks are that important. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nOkay. \nBrian Williams:\nIt'd be nice, but because we're already covered, we can make it work. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nRight, right. That's what I'm kind of thinking. Like, not that. It's all like a money game, But it also would save you a little bit of money. Or at least like the use of fatch until you actually need it, potentially. So I feel like February 1st. Or March 1st, depending on how you want to make that work, is maybe better than January 1st, just since she won't be a W-2 employee until January 16th. \nBrian Williams:\nOkay. Is there anything I need to update in the satch profile to let you guys know that we're running payroll on the 16th? Because I think when I first put it in, I thought payroll was going to be starting on the 1st, but we were too late for that. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nThe only thing you would do... It's just let me confirm one thing. Do you have all your info for deal that you could like put it into? Oh, you're synced to deal already. Oh, then no, you don't have to do anything else. I think, see, I'm looking at your pay schedule here, and it says semi-monthly. It says first payday, the 15. So this can be modified if you need it to be modified. I can show you the screen I'm looking at. \nBrian Williams:\nSure. Yeah. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nLet's see. This one here. So this is in payroll deductions here, and then I just move this over. Go on, where'd it go? Payroll deduct OH settings and then payroll, and then manage the custom pay schedule, and you have it set to semi-monthly pay for consumer monthly. First payday is the 15th, second payday is the 31st, so if the next one's going to be, let's see. Looks like this might be correct. Because I think you said the first paycheck would actually go down the 30th, so you probably chose right nearest business day to have that check go through. And then you could also see. Because then it would be the February, it would be February 15, then probably February 28th would be the next two. \nBrian Williams:\nSo we should we edit the schedule, or does that not matter, because deal will automatically sort of sync with that? \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nI guess this doesn't actually matter too much. Because if you're providing 100 coverage, then there's going to be no employee deduction, so this actually really won't matter. So, yeah, so if you're covering 100% of a premium, the employee is not going to have anything set up, then actually, I don't think this will matter at all, because there'll be no deduction report to do anything with. So the main setting with deals, if there is, or any payroll system, is if there is an employee contribution. And it doesn't sound like there will be because you're providing enough to cover the entirety of a premium. \nBrian Williams:\nYeah. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nOkay. I think you're good there. I think that should be okay. Trying anything else? I guess I'll just make a note on my end. Um, that like kind of TBD on January 1st, and if you don't want to do January 1st, we'll just update the coverage. Start date in Thatch, so Thatch, appropriately, UM, calculates when someone's eligible to actually accept the acre benefit. If you want to start January 1st. Technically, everyone has until the end of February to choose a plan, but they're benefits wouldn't start until the following month. So you have 60 days to enroll in a plan, technically, once you're offered it. So yeah, just let me know, I guess the coverage start date, I'll make a note on my end and then you can let me know if there's any update there. \nBrian Williams:\nOkay, yeah. So I'll let you know February or March. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nPerfect. That sounds great. Yeah, it doesn't matter to me either one, like, whatever works best for you guys as a business and for the employee. So that sounds good. \nBrian Williams:\nOkay. And it sounds like there's some information I need to give you on the dependents. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nLet me see here. Like, for my email, What did I say to you? What did I tell you? No, I think you're fine. No, I think you're okay. Because if I was going to create a custom quote to like, provide a higher allowance or something on the percentage side, then I would need to know more info on the dependents. But I think you're good. If you're set with that, you know, 2000 or 2100, about whatever you want to set that as, as the flat allowance. And that's all good. \nBrian Williams:\nOkay. Well, thanks for helping me through this. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nYou are so welcome. If you have any other questions, let me know. It's shockingly a slower week. I don't really know why. I guess people have their benefits now, but now I'm just kind of getting people on board and stuff. So feel free to reach out with any questions. \nBrian Williams:\nOkay. \nMonica Hirschheimer:\nPerfect. Enjoy the rest of your day. Take care. Bye. \n",

KEY POINTS DISCUSSED\n\nHealthcare Benefits Strategy for 2026-2027\n\n2026 Transition Year Approach:\n- Decision made to maintain salaried dynamic allowance structure for ALL employees in 2026, including dependent coverage\n- This approach chosen over switching Rachel to hourly immediately, as it provides a smoother transition period\n- Estimated budget: ~$25K for existing employees plus coverage for new hire\n- Rationale: Avoids disruption while organization transitions to long-term strategy\n\n2027 and Beyond - Long-term Strategy:\n- Plan to switch to individual-only coverage (no dependent coverage) starting 2027\n- Rachel will be reclassified to hourly with flat allowance in 2027 to maintain her coverage level\n- All other salaried employees will remain on dynamic allowance but individual-only\n- This change will significantly reduce costs and administrative complexity\n\nKey Decision Factors:\n- Priest wants to maintain salaried structure for new hires\n- Current employee population analysis shows most don't need dependent coverage:\n  - Andrew: Individual coverage only\n  - Patrick: Will be individual after wife switches to Medicare\n  - Kenny: Has Medicaid coverage\n- Future hires unlikely to need extensive dependent coverage\n\nAllowance Structure Decisions\n\nDynamic vs. Flat Allowance:\n- Dynamic allowance preferred for salaried employees as it allows more efficient use of dollars\n- Enables better coverage across diverse employee needs\n- Flat allowance will be used only for Rachel (hourly classification) starting 2027\n\nCoverage Levels:\n- Maintaining first percentile gold coverage standard\n- Employees working 30+ hours considered full-time (eligible for benefits)\n- Excess allowance policy: If implemented for one employee, must apply to all (decision pending)\n\n2.

            "transcript": "Kameron Schmidt:\nAnna, how are you? Good, how are you? I'm good. \nAnna Boon:\nI wanna keep this quick since you've already spent a lot of time with us, but I talked to our, our priest on Friday and he really wants to maintain a salaried rule for any new hires. So he was more, he was more inclined to switch Rachel to hourly. Sure. I think, as I thought about it over the weekend solves for Rachel's situation, but I think continuing to cover dependence for future hires puts us in kind of the same boat that we are in now, which is, we're probably overpaying to cover a lot of people, but as I looked at our population and we don't know who we're gonna obviously hire, but Andrew, I think we'll continue for the foreseeable future to, to be an individual. Patrick's gonna be an individual being covered on, you know, traditional healthcare plans only until his wife switches to Medicaid. And then I think he's really like, I think that's a low reimbursement rate Yeah. For her. And then I, I think that Kenny or Kenny will continue to have Medicaid and so if I think about the future for our organization, I think there's probably, I think it maybe makes sense to, to keep everybody on one standardized salaried sort of allowance calculation for this year. Yeah. Knowing it's gonna be a little bit more expensive and then next year switch ratio to salaried, or excuse me, to hourly to, to bump to have the ability to bump her allowance up Yeah. And switch to individual only and no dependents next year. Okay. Next year as in 2027. Right, Right. And so I, I, the more I thought about that, like we'd just probably have a year of like transition, I would say, to what needs to be the future state. Sure. Versus trying to adapt like to an individual only policy for this year. Rachel gets left out. Yeah. Then we probably are gonna have problems with Patrick this year having his coverage that he, we need to sort of throws things off. So I, I was just thinking about this year as like a little bit of a transition year. Yeah. So I put that in a spreadsheet. I don't know, I know I just sent this like a little bit ago and you've probably been in meetings since I shared it, but is that okay if I share that really quickly? Yeah. And make sure that like this isn't stupid. And then also I sent you an email which I plan to plan to send to our priest. Yes. The reason this is so complex is I have to be smart enough to explain this to not only our priest but a group of 10 people tonight. Right, right. And so I just wanna make sure I don't misspeak in any of this, so I'm sorry to have you be reviewing my communication. \nKameron Schmidt:\nNo, you're good. \nAnna Boon:\nBut I don't wanna explain something incorrectly. Yeah. So let me pull up this spreadsheet, if you don't mind taking a quick look at that email and letting me know if I just missed Yeah, Bruce misstated anything. \nKameron Schmidt:\nNo, you're good. So yeah, I read the email, I didn't, I didn't see the spreadsheet so I'll take a glance at the spreadsheet as well. But I read the email before our meeting. I did not see anything. You didn't miss anything. The only thing, like if I'm like, and I would, the only thing I wanna delineate is it's, it's not Medicaid, it's Medicare. \nAnna Boon:\nI always, I always do that word I've, I've been in this industry, I've been in healthcare for ages. I always, always switch it up. Medicare. Okay. Hold on a second. Yeah, thank you. Even as I was typing it, I was like I got it right, didn't I? \nKameron Schmidt:\nOkay, thank you. \nAnna Boon:\nYou're Good. \nKameron Schmidt:\nOf course. Yeah. The reason I would like, I just wanna point that out is just that state, There's a big difference. \nAnna Boon:\nMedicaid is state, Medicare is federal. I know, know the difference. I just always completely No. \nKameron Schmidt:\nYeah, for sure. I didn't want you to confuse anybody, but yeah, no, Thank you. Other than that, I think everything else made sense. \nAnna Boon:\nCan you look at the dynamic structure if someone doesn't, oh no. Wait, hold on. Oh, the very first bullet under important notes on allowances, both allowance structures dynamic and flat would allow someone to purchase individual or dependent coverage. Is that correct? Correct. \nKameron Schmidt:\nOkay, good. \nAnna Boon:\nAlright, good. So let's look at this spreadsheet really fast. Okay. And I think, and I had one specific question about this. Okay, so this is my thought process. One second, lemme move my zoom tools outta the way. Okay, so for 2026 we've got a new hire coming. We don't know what their situation is in terms of if they're gonna have dependents or not. Right. But regardless, maintain a salary dynamic allowance for everybody, including dependent coverage. Correct. So all those premiums that you listed would apply, Rachel included, which would be about 20 5K, which should be, she should be able to purchase what she's had historically on that. Correct. \nKameron Schmidt:\nOkay. \nAnna Boon:\nPatrick, assuming Kathy switched to Medicare after turning Okay. Decline, he's probably gonna stay as an individual Medicare, Medicare premiums for him and dependent. And then I think this is probably, we probably need to budget like as high as maybe Rachel ish on this. We don't know who we're gonna, would you say that that's a fair assumption? \nKameron Schmidt:\nLike just Well it would, I guess, sorry if I'm not understanding like the question but you Yeah. As an organization, yeah. You might want to budget for that. I don't think realistically like I don't, the odds of maybe you hiring someone that's gonna have as many dependences as Rachel, I don't, I wouldn't say are very high, but Yeah, technically you'll have to budget for it because they're going to have the same level of coverage as Rachel. So like apologize if I'm not make explaining this correctly. But yeah, like hypothetically if you do hire someone that has as many dependents as Rachel, they'll have the same, approximately the same allowance as Rachel. But if you hire someone with the same amount of dependences as Andrew, they're gonna have the same, right. \nAnna Boon:\nRight. \nKameron Schmidt:\nExactly. Yeah. Okay. \nAnna Boon:\nAnd then here's, I have one big question about this. So I think I said this switch Rachel to hourly. Yeah. Suffer a a flat, give her a flat allowance. Probably, I don't know if I'm like trying not to split hairs like Yeah, I don't know if we delineate flat versus dynamic. I was also playing around with like, do we wanna give the, give ourselves the option to keep everybody at a flat allowance next year? I don't know if there's rationale for if we're gonna be making a switch to what I would call like twenty, twenty seven and beyond. Yeah. We wanna make a recommendation that every, all the salary and employees just have a flat allowance versus a dynamic. \nKameron Schmidt:\nHere's what I'll say about that is I will say that employers that do you care about, and I know you guys are trying to, you know, might dial back your coverage a little bit, but I know you guys still want to cover them. Well, employers don't wanna do that. Yeah. They're gonna have a, they're gonna be able to do that more efficiently with the dynamic allowance than the flat allowance To be, to be able to take care of everybody. \nAnna Boon:\nYeah. \nKameron Schmidt:\nYou like you can, you can more efficiently use your dollars on the dynamic allowance towards a really good plan or a good plan as opposed to the flat allowance. Like you end up giving everyone the same amount of money, but some people will get the short end of the stick, some people don't and then you're not spending your money efficiently. Yeah. \nAnna Boon:\nBut We could do flat for Rachel since that's just one person. Yeah. \nKameron Schmidt:\nYeah. You could do it for Rachel, but then Hypothe. Yeah, I guess if, yeah. Yeah, I was gonna say if you ever hired someone hourly, then they would have the same allowance as she would have. Right, right. \nAnna Boon:\nYeah. \nKameron Schmidt:\nYeah. And I'm think I may. Okay. \nAnna Boon:\nAnd then last question, I think, do you know number of hours somebody has to work to to where we're legally required to provide them insurance? If they're hourly? \nKameron Schmidt:\nI mean, I'm pretty sure they, I mean it'd just be the full time, Like 40 hours. Well actually you don't even have to provide insurance, right. Like unless you're, unless you're of 50 employees or more, I don't think you even need like legally have to offer insurance. \nAnna Boon:\nBut since, since we're offering it for one hourly employee. \nKameron Schmidt:\nRight? Right. Yes. Yes. If you're offering it to one, you have to offer it to everyone and so anything above 30 hours is considered full-time. Okay. And anything below 30 hours is part-time. Okay. \nAnna Boon:\nAlright. Hold on a second. Lemme me apply to any other employees hired as any other, let me just, This is the main question. I thought it was 32, but, okay. Alright. So you say flat is good as long assuming we're not gonna like be spinning this cross multiple people, then we probably switch to dynamic again and then, and we can up the flat allowance every year. We can adjust that and then she can use that for herself or others and then we can keep everybody, and I think we switch to individual, this person's gonna end up having to just be told when they're hired, hey, you're gonna get dependent coverage this year, but after this year you're not gonna get it. Yeah, Yeah. He's not gonna need dependents after this year. I'm assuming he wouldn't, but you know, you never know. And then, and I, and I'm saying that because his wife might need to switch over if they have a child and then Kenny's not gonna need that either. Correct. \nKameron Schmidt:\nOkay. \nAnna Boon:\nSo you, how do you feel about my plan? \nKameron Schmidt:\nI like it. I, I like the simplicity of it for this year. I agree. It's like let's get like the, if we're going for one year and it gives you time to transition and then you can make the changes next year. Okay. \nAnna Boon:\nYeah. \nKameron Schmidt:\nI like it. I think it's good. Okay, good. \nAnna Boon:\nI just thought like if we switch over, if we do Rachel hourly, I'm saying this out loud so I can explain it then we're still a little bit still stuck with some of the same challenges for Patrick for having more, more coverage than Andrew needs. Less than Patrick's need needs even in that dynamic model for this year. \nKameron Schmidt:\nYeah. Okay. Okay. \nAnna Boon:\nLike, so moving Rachel to hourly this year doesn't really solve for anything long term. \nKameron Schmidt:\nI'm just gonna, yeah, I, I guess I got, I don't wanna, I don't want to confuse things, but I think, I guess we're not like, let's say hypothetically and again, I think we should just go Yeah, no, That's good. But hypothetically, if you did move Rachel to a different class, to hourly this year, I mean Patrick and Andrew would still have like the same allowance as they're going to right now, presumably. \nAnna Boon:\nYeah. And I'm thinking about that new hire we would still end up having more than he or she needs Depending on, yeah. \nKameron Schmidt:\nSo like basically if we get rid of, if, if, if we take Rachel into hourly then for this year then you could just hire the new hire without dependent coverage and like everybody's going to be, we'd be doing dynamic so everyone would be covered exactly as they need to be covered for the first percentile gold. Right. \nAnna Boon:\nAnd so I think this is the thing, lemme just say it like this because we need to keep dependent coverage on there for Patrick This year. Oh yeah, yeah. Yep. Then we would have to o offer dependent coverage for the hire and I don't really wanna do that one. Got it. \nKameron Schmidt:\nYep. I'm forgetting. Yep. Okay. Is that, is That correct? \nAnna Boon:\nYep, You're right. \nKameron Schmidt:\nYep. Okay. So yeah, in that case we just wanna offer everyone the same coverage this year and then next year we're just not covering dependents except, And then, and then our way to keep Rachel whole Yeah. \nAnna Boon:\nIs to switch or do a new class. Yep. \nKameron Schmidt:\nOkay, cool. I'm with you now. Yep. Okay. \nAnna Boon:\nYep. Alright, Karen, keep your finger and then, and then back to this whole, like, if somebody doesn't use their whole allowance either dynamic or flat, that's okay. We can opt to give them that excess or not give them that excess. Yes. \nKameron Schmidt:\nSo that's a decision you need to come up to decide and, 'cause if you do it for one person, you have to do it for everybody. \nAnna Boon:\nGotta do it though the same way. Okay. Yep. I need to probably add a note in there. Okay. This is great. I said I wasn't gonna use the whole time. Yeah. And so we're gonna, we're gonna roll with this camera and we're gonna see how this goes. \nKameron Schmidt:\nAll right, Ann. Good luck tonight. \nAnna Boon:\nSee, we can get ourselves straight tonight hopefully in a larger conversation. Okay. \nKameron Schmidt:\nI eagerly await to hear how it goes. \nAnna Boon:\nOh, okay. All right. We'll talk to you later. \nKameron Schmidt:\nAll right, see you Anna. Bye. \nAnna Boon:\nBye. \n",

Objectives\n- Reconcile year-end medical deduction discrepancies between Crossroads' Workday system and Thatch's year-to-date reporting\n- Resolve employer medical (allowance) calculation issues affecting W-2 reporting\n\n2. Key Updates / Progress\n- Blocker Identified: Thatch's employer medical (allowance) reporting does not accurately account for biweekly pay schedules (26 pay periods vs. 12 monthly calculations)\n- Root Cause: Thatch system calculates allowances on a monthly basis, but Crossroads operates on biweekly payroll, creating mathematical discrepancies when months have 3 pay periods\n- Medical Pre-Tax & Post-Tax: Most discrepancies explained by terminations, coverage timing issues, or carrier cancellation delays\n- Specific Cases Reviewed: Sarah Johnson and Tanya Martin showed employer medical discrepancies that don't reconcile with expected calculations\n- System Limitation: No month-to-month allowance change tracking available in Thatch platform without reviewing individual payroll reports\n\n3. Client Input / Feedback\n- Emily expressed frustration with Thatch reporting accuracy: \"I don't trust you guys' reporting numbers\"\n- Critical deadline: Emily needs accurate reconciliation data by Thursday night (December 18, 2025) at 5:00 PM Eastern for W-2 processing\n- Payroll must be processed Monday, December 22, 2025\n- Client concern: \"From an employer perspective, you guys are a facilitator of our plans, your numbers should be accurate\"\n- Emily identified ~20 employees requiring individual investigation beyond employer medical issues\n- Specific problem employees flagged: Judith Hardin and Elizabeth Hines (known account issues)\n\n4. Action Items\n- [Zafreen Arefy] → Assemble working group with payroll team, Caroline (servicing), and Mateo to address employer medical calculation methodology → 2025-12-17\n- [Zafreen Arefy & Ryan Hanchett] → Investigate 20 flagged employees from Emily's list and provide explanations → 2025-12-17 (before scheduled call)\n- [Zafreen Arefy] → Review Judith Hardin and Elizabeth Hines accounts specifically due to known issues → 2025-12-17\n- [Thatch Team] → Provide accurate reconciliation numbers for employer medical that account for biweekly pay schedule → 2025-12-18 (by 5:00 PM ET)\n- [Emily Bruns] → Complete EIB (payroll integration file) for W-2 processing → 2025-12-19\n- [Emily Bruns] → Submit payroll to team → 2025-12-20\n\n5. Notes\n- Emily had been incorrectly entering employee premium amounts instead of allowance amounts earlier in the year, contributing to some discrepancies\n- The 2026 date display issue in Thatch platform caused initial confusion during reconciliation\n- Penny rounding occurs due to biweekly conversion, but doesn't account for the magnitude of discrepancies found\n- Example discrepancy: Sarah Johnson showed $58.92 difference; Tanya Martin showed $124 difference\n- Rehire cases (e.g., Andrea Shipman) present additional complexity with missed pay periods\n- Some terminated employees show Crossroads owes them money back, requiring verification before processing refunds\n- Thatch made methodology changes mid-year affecting how coverage dates are displayed for terminated employees\n- Regular check-in meeting scheduled for December 17, 2025 to address non-employer-medical questions\n\nGranola Summary\n\nObjectives so far:\n- Reconcile year-end 2025 medical deduction discrepancies between Crossroads Workday and Thatch reporting systems\n- Resolve employer medical allowance calculation methodology issues\n- Ensure accurate W-2 reporting for tax year 2025\n- Investigate ~20 flagged employee accounts with specific discrepancies\n\nProgress made:\n- Identified root cause: Thatch calculates employer allowances monthly while Crossroads operates biweekly payroll (26 vs. 12 periods)\n- Confirmed medical pre-tax and post-tax discrepancies are mostly explainable (terminations, coverage timing)\n- Narrowed focus to employer medical calculation methodology as primary issue\n- Assembled cross-functional team (payroll, servicing) to address calculation problem\n- Documented specific employee cases requiring investigation\n\nOutstanding issues:\n- Thatch's employer medical reporting doesn't accurately reflect biweekly pay schedule reality\n- Mathematical discrepancies ranging from $58-$124+ per employee for employer allowances\n- No readily available month-to-month allowance change tracking in Thatch platform\n- ~20 employees require individual account investigation\n- Judith Hardin and Elizabeth Hines accounts have known issues affecting accuracy\n- Rehire cases (Andrea Shipman) show missed deductions requiring clarification\n- Some terminated employees may be owed refunds, requiring verification\n\nNext steps:\n- Working group to develop solution for biweekly vs. monthly calculation discrepancy by 2025-12-18\n- Zafreen and Ryan to investigate 20 flagged employees before 2025-12-17 meeting\n- Provide Emily with accurate reconciliation data by 2025-12-18, 5:00 PM ET (hard deadline)\n- Emily to complete EIB file by 2025-12-19 for payroll processing\n- Hold scheduled check-in on 2025-12-17 to address non-employer-medical questions\n- Long-term: Thatch product team to review billing/reporting improvements based on Emily's feedback"

                "value": "Account Notes: Crossroads and Thatch - Year-End Reconciliation and ICHRA Context\n\n1. Key Points Discussed:\n\n- ICHRA and 2026 Renewal Costs: While the conversations primarily focused on payroll reconciliation and reporting issues, the underlying theme of managing costs and reducing administrative workload aligns with the employer's interest in ICHRA. The discussions on operational improvements, carrier delays, and FAQ development indirectly support the goal of streamlining processes and managing costs effectively.\n\n- Payroll Reconciliation Challenges: Significant discrepancies were identified between Crossroads' Workday system and Thatch's reports, particularly concerning employer medical allowances and pre-tax/post-tax deductions. The root causes included differences in calculation methodologies (monthly vs. biweekly) and system limitations in reporting.\n\n- System Limitations and Solutions: Thatch's reporting system faced challenges in accurately reflecting year-to-date data, especially for off-boarded employees and allowance changes. Solutions included updating Metabase reports and providing comprehensive year-to-date enrollment data.\n\n2. Stakeholders Involved:\n\n- Crossroads (Customer/Employer):\n  - Emily Bruns: Primary contact responsible for payroll reconciliation and W-2 preparation.\n  - Crossroads Payroll Team: Processes payroll and requires updated information for year-end processing.\n\n- Thatch (Vendor):\n  - Zafreen Arefy: Account Manager/Customer Success, coordinating resolution efforts.\n  - Ryan Hanchett: Payroll Specialist, technical expert on deduction calculations.\n  - Kara Kubarych: Account support/Implementation, tracking communications and providing context.\n  - Eric Kim: Technical/Implementation specialist, analyzing deduction reports.\n  - Caroline and Mateo: Team members involved in resolving reporting issues.\n  - Thatch Engineering/Product Team: Addressing report limitations and data issues.\n\n3. Important Milestones and Timestamps:\n\n- December 12, 2025: Last payroll period included in current reconciliation reports.\n- December 15, 2025: Identification and resolution of Metabase report pay period issue.\n- December 16, 2025: Discovery of systematic calculation discrepancies affecting year-end W-2 reporting.\n- December 19, 2025 (5:00 PM ET): Hard deadline for providing accurate reconciliation data to complete EIB file.\n- December 22, 2025: Employee deadline for submitting qualified medical expense documentation.\n- January 12, 2026: Internal Thatch deadline for documentation to ensure W-2 accuracy.\n\n4. Next Steps with Deadlines and Responsible Parties:\n\n- Immediate Actions (By December 19, 2025, 5:00 PM ET):\n  - Zafreen Arefy to lead a working group with Ryan, Caroline, and Mateo to investigate flagged employee discrepancies and provide accurate reconciliation data.\n  - Ryan Hanchett to assist with background investigation and resolve calculation methodology issues.\n  - Emily Bruns to attend the next scheduled check-in call and complete the EIB file with corrected data.\n\n- Ongoing/Future Actions:\n  - Thatch Product Team to receive documentation on billing display improvements needed to prevent future reconciliation issues.\n  - Thatch to implement better reporting that accounts for biweekly pay schedules vs. monthly"

I do think that I figured out the um other portion of it, which I sent you, the highlighted people that I need to like, review and I had questions on. But everyone else made sense, like they were terminated and we couldn't collect their last payments, or their insurance was active an additional month. And like, that's creating the discrepancies like those. I'm okay on. Um, ones I sent you were the ones I had questions on. Um, Um, I go ahead and get started. \nZafreen Arefy:\nYeah, let's go ahead and get started. Share your screen. Because I want to make sure I can take this back to our payroll team if I'm not able to figure it out. Okay. \nEmilyBruns:\nAll right. So this is kind of a mess, but I've been like trying to make it work in my brain, what it looks like. So I have the report here from the employer, medical portion of it. And I've separated out the people who are already on my med. Pre-list, because I know those are people we need to look at and may explain some of the discrepancy. However, I do know that there will probably be something I have to do. Because, like I mentioned yesterday, I know for a fact, I was putting the employee's contribution amount or their premium amount rather than the allowance amount. So I know there's discrepancy there. So I've narrowed it down to like this group of people. And. My issue is, and this like, messed up here, but your report, so this is workday. This is what the year to date that report was showing. So this is the difference between the two. And for some people, it's a little bit, but for some people, it's more. And I'm trying to figure out where the difference is coming from, like, what happened, yada, yada. Let me clear this so I can show you. So, like this employee, for example, she's still currently employed. I downloaded the spend report to get the like month to month deduction. But then I determined that the spend report is there. actual, it's showing their actual premium, not the allowance. So that's not helpful because I can't see the month to month change for their allowance amount, which is what I'm trying to reconcile. So I don't have anything else to go off of to check why this is so different. Other than going into every single payroll report you guys have provided since January, and figuring out each person what their amount was on those reports. \nZafreen Arefy:\nYeah. Let me see if I can look her up really quickly, because I'm going to be honest with you, Emily, That's what payroll team came back to me about, where I was like, is she going to have to go into every single pay period? And they were like, at this moment in time, yes, because we annualize at the end so that it evens out, but in your, or like, zeros out, But in your case, you want to find the discrepancies. Let me look up this person specifically. \nEmilyBruns:\nLike, not even necessarily this. Specific discrepancy? I just like, again, respectfully, I've said this before, like, I don't trust you guys. Reporting numbers, there's like, more issues with them. So like, if you're telling me that there's a thousand dollar, twelve hundred dollar difference from what we're showing. We've given her versus this, like, I want to make sure that that's accurate before I add that to her. W-2. So I'm trying to like, spot check a few people to check that. But again, without having to go into every single payroll file to make sure like. There's nothing in the platform that shows if her deduction or her allowance changed. Like, if she moved, like, there's, that's not readily available without having to look at it individually. \nZafreen Arefy:\nYeah, no, I, I completely hear you. I'm looking at her, this person. I'm just trying to see if, like, I can use this person example to see where I can help you and supplement. Let me see. Okay, so it looks like for this person, for Lauren, is that her name? Yes. It took us a little bit for her to actually respond to us, to confirm with her that her premium is in fact $60 a month. And then it looks like she's got a bunch of transactions. So basically what you're charged so for her? oh, she's like an edge case where what you're being charged for her is, um, her, I don't think she has any reimbursements, actually. So perhaps it's actually fine. So you're just being charged for her, for her allowance. And for her in particular, it doesn't look like we ever changed her. $60 a month. It looks like that's where we were always at, but let me just double check. Cause that 12 does not make sense. \nEmilyBruns:\nRight. But I want to know her allowance amount. Like, in theory, somebody used all of their allowance, whether they had a like this, she's a different case, and I can pull someone else too, but like, let's just say, like, she didn't owe extra. Like, like, this is what we ended up paying for her. That's reimbursement aside. If you take 315 and multiply it by 12 months, it's 3,780. So where is your system getting this 4,300 from? \nZafreen Arefy:\nThe one you're looking at right now, Emily, is 2026. Like, what the screen you're showing. \nEmilyBruns:\nOh, good call. \nZafreen Arefy:\nNo, I hate that you did that. Yeah. Oh, I find myself gaslighting myself all the time. \nEmilyBruns:\nOkay, let's try this. 374.25 Times 12. Okay, so it's still your year-to-date total. And you put it as a 12-12, though, right? Yes. Okay, so then, okay. 12-15, yeah, the one that I sent you yesterday. So this, plus her biweekly deduction, would be... \nZafreen Arefy:\nSo I'm looking at her account and seeing if her premium change or not. premium, sorry, allowance changed at all. So it looks like for her, her allowance was the same all year. \nEmilyBruns:\nOK, so then she is kind of a good case. So her allowance is the same all year. Three, seventy four, twenty five times twelve would be four thousand, four hundred and ninety one. Okay, so... That is what your report is showing first. So I, first of all, was looking at 2026, which freaking stupid. But OK. OK, so that would make sense. But what if someone did change their deduction? Are your numbers accounting for that? \nZafreen Arefy:\nSo it's supposed to. Yeah. So I asked about that and they said, because we're showing you the annualized amount, it's taking into account, which is why we don't show the monthly, I guess, that they're right here. Let me pull up the exact rationale that you shared with me. One second. Okay, so it says. So I said, how is it typically handled in the year-to-date report when an address changes mid-year? And it says, the year-to-date report is smart enough that it pulls up the premiums and allowances for each month based on the employee's allowance and plans, etc. At the time. Then it sums them up to get the annualized amount. \nEmilyBruns:\nBased on their deduction. Say that again at the time. \nZafreen Arefy:\nCorrect. So, meaning if I change my allowance in or, sorry, I change my address. In November, when we run the year to date report, when that goes into effect, like, say, that's supposed to go into effect into December. When you pull the year to date for December, it'll show a different amount for me. So it'll show in theory, if I'm getting less allowance, it'll show less money in. December. So it'll, it'll calculate it correctly. Does that make sense? But I hear what you're saying, where you want to show it, like, I just called out. \nEmilyBruns:\nYeah. Because, like, that's just putting a lot of trust in the thatch file. And like, some of these numbers are really big that I'm having to, like, reconcile the employee for. And then also, like, okay, let's look at Lauren again, for example, let me write this down so I can help it make sense, which is where I was trying to, like, yeah, understand where we went wrong on our side. So hers is probably more because her premium amount was really, really low. So if I look at her payroll. \nZafreen Arefy:\nAlso, I really appreciate you walking this room with me. Because I'm putting together a document to share with our product team of how we need our billing to actually show and not have customers. \nEmilyBruns:\nI guess small people just don't really care. Or it's not that hard to look at it on a one-to-one, but I'm looking at hundreds of people. It's brutal. \nZafreen Arefy:\nOkay, let's, and that's what I'm trying to advocate for. Because I'm just like, most of my clients are your size. I'm like, guys, this doesn't work for me. No, it doesn't. \nEmilyBruns:\nOkay, so I filtered by her employer contribution amount. So, see, initially, I was only doing the 64 and the 29. Because I thought it was just their premium amount, not the allowance. So okay, hers makes sense why it's such a large difference, because her allowance amount versus her actual premium was, like, very large. There's something that that margin is narrower. So I think at this point in time, like, I'm just going to have to trust that you guys report is correct. So anyone who we like, I see the negative for, I'll have to go in and adjust by like, this number here, which is fine, positive, like, I'm more than you think that we should have. So let's look at one of those examples. \nZafreen Arefy:\nUm, yeah, yeah, please choose somebody, then I can look them up. \nEmilyBruns:\nLet's look at Let me actually see. Yes. Sarah Johnson. \nZafreen Arefy:\nLet's see what happened here. Let me double check to see if we changed something. Let's count. Interesting. Okay, so for her right now, her allowance has not changed at all. So I'm seeing, let me see if she had a QLE. \nEmilyBruns:\nIt looks like she probably did because I'm showing, well, actually, I don't know. The coverage dates on one of the files I pulled said 9-1 to 12-31. But then again, here in the, oh my God, it's 2026, freaking 2026. Okay, yeah. So she had coverage September through December. \nZafreen Arefy:\nYeah, so that's what I'm seeing as well. Let me see. \nEmilyBruns:\nAlso, whoever you need to tell about the stupid 2026 stuff, that's also stupid. \nZafreen Arefy:\nIt's very frustrating. It should be until the year it's in. Yes, we shouldn't move it until January 1st. I completely agree. Okay, let me see. Also, for me, I also have to check, like, a couple different places, so I appreciate your patience here, too. \nEmilyBruns:\nNo, you're good. Which, like, also shouldn't be the case for you, either. \nZafreen Arefy:\nYou know, it is what it is. Um, okay. oh, okay. So here's what happened with her. Um, it looks like because of how many pay periods you guys have, I can't remember if it's if it's versus the even number or the odd number of pay periods that we will change the amount. So, like this is where the penny rounding causes some discrepancies. And that's what I'm seeing happening here. So like, we had her originally, the it like being like, but how much was her discrepancy? How much were you seeing? \nEmilyBruns:\nWas it like, 12, something like no, like 60.58, 92, that's more than a few pennies. \nZafreen Arefy:\nYeah, why are we okay? So what's this one's show? Did she change her address? because I see in our report, we have two updates to her account. I'm trying to understand why. How much were you deducting from her? \nEmilyBruns:\nPer pay period, it was $176.88, which matches exactly the employer allowance. If you do this, times 12, divided by 26. \nZafreen Arefy:\nOkay, so for her, her premium is more than her. Let me double check. Yeah, her premium is more than her allowance. So. 325. 2025, yes. Okay. So her deduction should be $1,884 each month. \nEmilyBruns:\nYep, for medical pre, but I want to know employer medical. \nZafreen Arefy:\nAnd so her medical that is listed on her account is $402.09. Which is what's showing here on the premium. Okay. Okay. So those, all those numbers are matching what I just shared with you. Okay. Yeah. And then her allowance is 383.25. \nEmilyBruns:\nRight. \nZafreen Arefy:\nSo why is your sheet showing something different? Exactly. \nEmilyBruns:\nAnd if I look at my, like, the way workday works is you have inputs. This is how we do it, for that, for each person. If there were any changes to these inputs, it would show me here. But as you can see, this $166,788, which is that exact number I just gave you, has been deducted. Every cycle since her coverage started, starting 8-16 to 12-19, which is the way the pay periods fall. So there's been no changes on my end for her either, insinuating that there's been no changes on the thatch file, because that's where I get this number. And then if I look at her most recent pay slip as of 12-12, to make sure my report is right, medical pre-tax. Nope, I'm looking for this one. Medical ER 176 88 year to date would be 14 1504, which is what I show. But your report, which also was as of 12 12, which is what mine is, as well, shows one that 1356, so it's a 5892 difference. \nZafreen Arefy:\nI'm wondering if it's showing for the month, like the full no, because we would have pulled you pulled it as a 12 yesterday. \nEmilyBruns:\nYeah, um, but even if it was showing for the full month, that's not even the difference of her monthly premium, which is 383.25. \nZafreen Arefy:\nYeah, um, why is this math not mathing, because we all have all the same numbers, so why is why are we off? 176.88 is how much you're deducting. Well, okay, actually from here, so this is perhaps where I'm getting myself confused. So technically, her deduction, and let me just go close all these other things, so I don't accidentally look at somebody else's. Sarah Johnson and her premium. Yep, and so her pre-tax amount, her deduction. Let's see equals divided by two 942. So technically, she should be getting. Her deduction amount is listed as 837 every month, so maybe this is where the discrepancy is happening. \nEmilyBruns:\nWhat do you mean, her deduction? \nZafreen Arefy:\nSo on our end, um, when we see, like, when we list like how much her pre-tax amount should be, we have it listed as, uh, eight dollars and 37 cents. And I see for a year, because we're breaking it down bi-weekly versus um, monthly, right? \nEmilyBruns:\nBut then that is the same. I have the same thing. Yeah, that number matches, so we're. We're accurately deducting her medical pre-tax appears. we are accurately deducting her medical employer paid the allowance. But your year-to-date totals don't match actually what it should be. Because if September, October, November, December, that's four months. If this is correct and her allowance has stayed the same all four months, it should be 383.25 times four would be 1533. So that's not even, your report's not even showing like through December. I don't know where the 1356 is coming from. \nZafreen Arefy:\nSo in your report, is it, okay, so the 13. Yeah, that doesn't actually match. \nEmilyBruns:\nAnd even if you took like, oh, well, maybe it's only going through 12-12, so half of that, then, theoretically, it should be remaining 176-88, but it's not that either. \nZafreen Arefy:\nYeah, let me see if I can get, how much time do you have? \nEmilyBruns:\nI have a two o'clock, but if I need to push it, I can. \nZafreen Arefy:\nOkay, let me see if I can get someone to jump on really quickly. Can we look at another person as well? \nEmilyBruns:\nLet me message this guy really quick. Yeah, this is more important than that meeting anyway. Um, okay, let me just pick someone random. Um, let's look at Tanya Martin, and first, you tell me if she's had any changes to her allowance. \nZafreen Arefy:\nOkay, so her, let's see. So it looks like something was updated in September. Oh, she had a couple, actually. So one, so she has an update to her account in April and then again in September. And then let me look at. Did she change her plan? Okay, so looking at her 2025, we have, she has coverage from April to December 31st. \nEmilyBruns:\nYep. \nZafreen Arefy:\nHer premium is $621.79. Okay, yep, so it's reflecting what's listed there. And then her allowance is $537. \nEmilyBruns:\nOkay. \nZafreen Arefy:\nAnd then I'm not seeing any changes here. \nEmilyBruns:\nI don't see that on my end either. And another example of that, let me pull up her payslip. So she had a penny change for the pre-tax, but that does not what we're looking at. So, from the first pay period, her coverage would have been active to December. I have her deduction showing $247.85. So again, this is, well, she could have been included because she started in March. She could have been included in, like, a little bit of a difference, but honestly not. Wait. Yeah, because her premium is more than that. So, yeah, this would be reflecting correctly. Um, $247.85 per pay period that we've taken, which matches the math for what our deductions year-to-date have been. But your file shows something $124 different. And again, her deduction is $247.85 per pay period. \nZafreen Arefy:\nI'm wondering if the issue here, because I'm trying to see if... Because we're not taking December into account, but then, like you said, it still doesn't make any sense. Because this is from year to date, so in theory. So I'm wondering if year to date would be, if it's at this point in time, then this is the information that we have as of December 15th. What happened here? What changed here with her? So in September, something changed on her account. And it doesn't look like, oh, it was a penny difference here. Okay, which you have noted. Let me pull up an Excel spreadsheet so I can start doing this math myself too, because not making sense. So can you remind me that 247 that you have deducted on your end, where are you pulling that number? So that way I can. Also do the numbers on my end. Yeah. \nEmilyBruns:\nSo her allowance, her monthly allowance is $537. So this math can be done just straight divided by the pay periods, because it doesn't matter. Like the premium, one can't. So coverage dates don't matter. So for her, I did 537 times 12, divided by 26. That gets me the biweekly deduction. That should be every pay period for, like, her employer medical contribution, which is 247.85. \nZafreen Arefy:\nOkay, and that makes sense. Um, okay, so for you guys. So this is where I I'm wondering if we're showing the same thing. But because of the way that we present the data, and however we're splicing, it is where some of these discrepancies are coming in. I think the gap that I'm missing is for this report, is this taking into account the month of December or not? And if it is taking into account the month of December, would it cut any, like, would it take out a portion? Like, is it prorated at all? It shouldn't be, though, because it's literally just what we've paid for this individual. \nEmilyBruns:\nAnd let me just see, so her last paycheck in November, Year-to-date total is showing 446130. That doesn't even show, like, if this was theoretically not showing December, that doesn't even show that. Because it'll be 446130. But, I mean, yeah, to your point, it could be prorating it, but, like, in what way is it prorating it? Exactly, yeah. \nZafreen Arefy:\nOkay, so, let me just, so. So for us, this is counting eight months because it's from April. \nEmilyBruns:\nIt's going to be nine, April, May, including December. \nZafreen Arefy:\nYeah, including December, it would be, right, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December. Nope, you're right, it's nine. Nine months. And so then the amount that we'd be paying for the premium. Okay, so her premium is more. Let's see. Equals, so 559611 is what it should be, including December for the premium amount, um, and then so it's just for premium total, allowance, total. \nEmilyBruns:\nwait, say that again. \nZafreen Arefy:\nSo for her premiums, I mean, premium, premium. \nEmilyBruns:\nOkay, but we're not okay. \nZafreen Arefy:\nSorry, go ahead. No, no, you're good, um, and then. And so the allowance should be four, eight, three, three for the nine months. And then in terms of how much we should have deducted on our end, so on thatch's end, um, how much you all should have been charged. Would be the year to date because in the last billing cycle we would have charged for December coverage. Um, and so this will be. You should have been charged for her 5, 596.11 because her premium is more than her allowance, and then in terms of how much, you should have deducted from her $763.11. Does that sound, right? \nEmilyBruns:\nI chose... As of the 12-12 pay period, or the full month, or the full December? \nZafreen Arefy:\nFor the full December. Okay, yeah. \nEmilyBruns:\nSo $724.97 plus $38.15. $763.12 is what I see. But if there's some penny differences, I'm not worrying about that. \nZafreen Arefy:\nWell, I have a penny difference. So I have $763.11. \nEmilyBruns:\nOkay, perfect. So, yeah, medical pre-tax matches. It's the employer medical that does not. \nZafreen Arefy:\nAnd now when you're saying employer medical, that is, and I apologize if you've already said this, this is what you have put in into the system in Workday. \nEmilyBruns:\nEmployer medical is the crossroads allowance amount. \nZafreen Arefy:\nOkay. \nEmilyBruns:\nAnd my numbers, like I said, I know, aren't going to match one-to-one for the ones that I like. Didn't do correctly. But like the ones that we actually are showing we owe money back to, those are the ones. I'm like, like, why is that showing that way? Because, like the one we just chatted about Lauren Mockridge, I see, oh yeah, it makes sense. I need to reconcile this because it was a thing on my end. But then the ones down here, especially people who have coverage starting after, like, May, like, they should be correct. Okay, Okay. \nZafreen Arefy:\nSo for here, I'm seeing for the pre-tax. Ooh, is he able to join? Please say yes. I'm seeing for pre-tax, we have listed for her as 3815. I'm around. Okay, he's available to jump on. \nEmilyBruns:\nIs it Eric? \nZafreen Arefy:\nNo, this is Ryan. He's one of our payroll specialists. Yeah. So the actual guy who builds the payroll stuff. \nEmilyBruns:\nOkay. Who are we looking at now? I already forgot. \nZafreen Arefy:\nWe were looking at Tanya Martin. Yeah. Okay. Let me share this with him. Hey, Ryan. You can be off camera if you want. Sounds good. Thank you so much for jumping on. Really appreciate it. Just very quickly, this is Emily from Crossroads. Not sure if you have crossed paths? \nRyan Hanchett:\nI don't think so. Nice to meet you. \nEmilyBruns:\nHi, nice to meet you. Appreciate you hopping on. \nZafreen Arefy:\nSo a couple of things here. Emily is in the process of reconciling her books at the end of the year. There are a couple of things where we just need to make sure she has everything she needs for discrepancies that she's seeing for employees. And so we were spot checking a couple of folks and I was also getting caught up in the math. And so I was hoping you'd be able to shed some light on some of the calculations she's showing and the different reports she's referencing. \nEmilyBruns:\nOK, so first off, I want to be clear, like, what I'm looking at. And Zephyrine, I think you have. You guys maybe should have someone joining our call tomorrow to look at the other deductions, or maybe we can address some of those now. But our deductions are spread across three sections. We have the medical pre-tax people, the medical post-tax people, and then what we call employer medical, but you guys refer to as the employer allowance, or crossroads allowance, thatch allowance, whatever it's called on your end. And I'm referring to specifically this number here for an individual employee. Okay. \nRyan Hanchett:\nOkay. \nEmilyBruns:\nSo on this report, Zafreen provided me the, I don't know what you guys call this, Zafreen. \nZafreen Arefy:\nYear-to-date report that we can download directly from the admin. \nEmilyBruns:\nYes. So I have compared it to my year to date report for these specific deductions. And I'm trying to reconcile any discrepancies from what we've taken versus what you guys say we should have taken or should not have taken. So there's a few that I had questions on for, like medical pre-tax, medical post-tax, But most of these discrepancies make sense in the sense that an employee terminated before we could. Recoup their additional like last balance the difference of. Or they had an extra month of coverage and we couldn't recoup it because they terminated, the carrier wouldn't cancel it. Situations like that, so that makes sense. There was a few that I emailed to her that I did need review on. Um, but my main thing right now is the employer medical portion of it. So same thing. I pulled my reports. I have an Excel here where I've added our totals. Your totals and then the differences that I'm showing. So the ones where it's saying we need to reconcile on our end, like we're showing we only deducted three thousand twenty nine. You guys are saying we should have deducted forty three, eighteen. So it's a difference of this separate and already chatted about this one. That makes sense to me because I know there was an error earlier in the year on my end. And I know what I need to do for these, for the most part. I'm assuming that all these negatives are in that same boat. But if I find one that's not, I'll let you know. But the question that I have is, scrolling down further, there are people that are in the positive, showing that we've taken more than what you think we should take. And the math just isn't mathing for these specific people. So was it Sarah that we looked at first, Zafreen? \nZafreen Arefy:\nYeah, Sarah. And then we looked at Tanya Martin after. \nEmilyBruns:\nLet me stop there. Any questions before I continue on this specific case? \nRyan Hanchett:\nUm, so the ER medical, and Zafri, maybe you can clear this up for me. So I understand the pre-tax and post-tax deductions. I'm a little, so. Would those be just anything beyond the allowance would be considered post-tax? \nEmilyBruns:\nIt is the allowance. So this employee, her premium was $621.79 a month. Crossroads is only giving her $537. She pays the rest. Payroll deductions. So what Crossroads is providing her is $537 a month. To me, that's employer medical. Okay. \nRyan Hanchett:\nUnderstood. So it's crossroads portion. \nEmilyBruns:\nYes. And we're on a biweekly pay schedule. So that's creating some issues, too, because we deducted biweekly, but then we're transitioning to monthly or biweekly, whatever. So that's the number I'm referring to, this allowance right here. Okay. So if we look at this lady, Sarah, specifically, I show this. From that, she's had coverage from, uh, yeah, September to December, which is four months total. Our year-to-date deduction for employer medical shows 14 15. Your report is telling me it should have been 13 56, creating a 58.92 difference from what we've actually taken to what you say we should have taken. But if I look at her in Thatch, and Zephyrine was looking on the back end as well. We don't see that she's had any plan changes for 2025 or any indication that her allowance has changed since September. So, in theory, if we do 383.25 times the four months that she's had coverage, we should be deducting 1533. Now, this is including December, and we don't believe that your report, or the report Zafreen pulled is fully showing December. But even assuming my numbers are through our 12-12 pay period, which would be half of what her amount is, so $176.88. So if I take the $383.25 times four, so this is what it should be by end of year, and I subtract her biweekly amount because we've already had one payroll. In December 176 88, it should be, Oh wait, Zafreen, is that it? \nRyan Hanchett:\nYeah, yeah. I do wonder if there might be some lag in our reporting to catch up for some of these things. \nEmilyBruns:\nWell, why does mine? Why is mine showing this? Though? 14 15? Hold on, let me go back to her, Okay, so I'm looking at her. Most recent payslip as of 12-12, and employer paid benefits show 14-15-04. And, okay, so I think I just... Found out where your number's coming from? But now I'm like, Is my number wrong? Hold on, let me rework my brain on this. Because when I look at her. Actual deductions and inputs that we've done employer Medical, we've done 176.88 times nine pay periods. So her coverage started September 1st. Our payroll schedule shows it would have been the first pay date in September. SO 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. It says nine. I'll just check something. Oh, my payroll team has already processed the next payroll in our platform. I think that's where I'm getting some issues from. Interesting. \nZafreen Arefy:\nYeah, that is really interesting. \nEmilyBruns:\nOkay, so then that should be her annualized total for 2026. Let's see if, okay. So then this should be your annual amount, right? Let's just do the math. 383.25 times four months of coverage. No, that still doesn't track that. It should be this number 1533. So if I do 1356, well, this one's 76, 88. Gets me $15.33. So this really is only showing one payroll in December, right? Let me see. $3.83, $3.25 times September, December, December, four months. \nZafreen Arefy:\n$15.33 is for four months of coverage. \nEmilyBruns:\nOkay, full coverage. \nZafreen Arefy:\nYeah, correct. So like, if we're talking about, er, medical, now that my brain has processed that as your allowance. It should be from September to December 1533 that she should have received. And yours is showing 1415. \nEmilyBruns:\nYeah, and there's the 1212 paycheck. \nZafreen Arefy:\nSo that aligns, oh wait, that's okay. This is where we're missing that $50. \nEmilyBruns:\nYeah, so we've had eight pay periods from the beginning of her coverage up until 12-12. And her bi-weekly employer contribution should be 176.88 times eight payrolls is 14-15.04. But your report- report like, it's like the numbers don't balance out when you split it bi-weekly. I guess, yeah, I think. \nZafreen Arefy:\nOr Ryan, you can speak more to that. Uh, that's what it seems like it's happening here. Because if we do the math, yeah, because it's monthly, so we. \nRyan Hanchett:\nI'm still not sure why our report wouldn't show full 1533 amount at this point since we're in December. \nEmilyBruns:\nAnd I'm wondering, too, if I go ahead and like, prompt mine and like, rerun it since they've done the, But it's not going to show as a deduction until it's actually deducted. Yeah. So it's like, I'm trying to prevent having to do like manual math, but 14. Sorry, my dog's barking. Okay, let's see. 1415 equals this plus this. Like, it's still, is there still? like, would I expect the payroll deduction file to have a different amount to reconcile actually what it should be? Because if this is my amount that we've taken up to 1212, we have one more payroll, and we would take 176.88. Per what the file shows, that would get us to 1591.92. But if you do just the flat 383.25 times four, it gets us the 1533. \nRyan Hanchett:\nYeah, yeah, I mean, looking at Sarah's UM allowance or balance history and Safrina, I do see that we've granted 1533. So I, I'm confused why our number is showing 1356, but I'm not. This is the like year end, year-to-date report, right? \nZafreen Arefy:\nYeah, yeah, let me just double check that. So What? Okay. Just because, Emily, I want to make sure you have what you need. I wonder, Ryan, would it make more sense for her to use the payroll deduction report? But that's also not all encompassing. Yeah. \nRyan Hanchett:\nYeah, because that doesn't include the allowance amounts or the employer medical portion. Correct. \nZafreen Arefy:\nYeah. \nEmilyBruns:\nAnd I'm also like. Even if my, like, whatever the file's going to show when it drops tomorrow, like, in theory, it should still have the $383.25. And then I do my calculation of this times 12 divided by 26 to get the biweekly amount. It still doesn't, like, I'm still going to be off because we're going to end up taking $15.91, but it should only be $15.33. \nZafreen Arefy:\nI'm really trying to rack my brain why this is. \nEmilyBruns:\nBecause it's not. Yeah. And even if you do 176, 88 times two, it gets you 176, 88 times two, 353, 353, 76 versus 383, 25 is what the month is showing. But see, it can't even be like. Times two. Because some of our pay months, we have three pay period, like, we just have. That's why I do it by the 26th. Yeah, yeah, because it's not exactly, oh, this is what you're having every month. \nZafreen Arefy:\nI'm going to see if, like the deduction report will, payroll deduction report will help here. Is the person's name Johnson? No, it's still the same. It's still showing we're going to deduct 837. \nEmilyBruns:\nYeah, and it doesn't, the LIKE Payroll Deduction report doesn't show employer medical year to date. \nZafreen Arefy:\nIt just shows what the allowance is at that point in time. Yeah. \nEmilyBruns:\nYeah. \nZafreen Arefy:\nRyan, I'm not sure if like. I mean, we're definitely have to think about this. I don't know if anything immediately comes to mind of how we could perhaps help. \nEmilyBruns:\nThis is also like confusing me for how I need to be calculating what we're giving people, because if I can't just do the flat like calculation of, OK, Their monthly total is 383.25, and then multiply it by 12 and then divide it by 26. Like, that number should be the same as what the month, like the annual, comes out to. But it's not. It's still. more. \nRyan Hanchett:\nYeah. \nEmilyBruns:\nYeah. \nRyan Hanchett:\nUnderstanding that, like, I know that with a lot of our deduction math, when we. When we convert things to biweekly pay schedules, there's a lot of, like, penny rounding issues. I don't know if that might be part of it, too, because, like, it doesn't come to a round number. A lot of the time, like an even per period deduction, like, we have to front load a lot of the pennies. I thought might be part of it. But yeah, what you're describing is what we do to try and get that number. Because, yeah, I see 17688.4. So at some point, it's like the extra remainder that needs to be reconciled, that doesn't quite fit nicely into. \nEmilyBruns:\nSure, but that's not going to equivalent, it's not going to equal this. Yeah, that's that's not going to be 58, which is what I initially found, too. So like, like this makes me feel so stupid, like it doesn't make sense. \nZafreen Arefy:\nI know I'm literally I'm also rocking my brain around here. And I apologize. Emily. I don't understand why this. Is it like, Ryan, is this gonna fix itself? Next pay period, or like in January? Perhaps? \nRyan Hanchett:\nUm, no, because we we tie things off at the end of the year. So what? What happens in this year doesn't like the last period of the year should be what evens everything out. \nEmilyBruns:\nIt seems to me like your system is truly only looking at this from a monthly perspective, which does not, which is not aligned with how our employees are paid and what they're actually getting. Because I can't just like, let's see, for a month, we had three payrolls in it. I can't just not give them their employer medical for this one. Because they still get it. They have a deduction that period. So their employer medical should function the same way. \nZafreen Arefy:\nYeah, 100%. \nEmilyBruns:\nLike, I think that your year to date total is an accounting like over the 26 pay periods, rather than a 12 month. Because that ends up being more. \nZafreen Arefy:\nHow many triple pay periods did you guys have? Or months that you get paid three times? \nEmilyBruns:\nI think there's two. Let me pull this back up. Hold on. I'm about to have to take my dog out. Yeah. \nZafreen Arefy:\nCome on. \nEmilyBruns:\nGo, go, go. \nRyan Hanchett:\nYeah, it looks like May and October. \nEmilyBruns:\nYeah, I think that sounds right. May, one, two, three. And October, yeah. \nRyan Hanchett:\nSo for this employee, it would have only been one since they started in September. \nEmilyBruns:\nSeptember, yeah. \nZafreen Arefy:\nYeah, so that's what I think we figured out here, at least. And please correct me if I'm totally off. That's where some of this discrepancy is coming in, because some of these. It's not lining up exactly for the multiple, the odd number of pay periods in one month or V-checks in one month. Yeah. \nEmilyBruns:\nWhich makes sense. But then again, like, we can't accurately tell someone, we're giving them $383 a month. And then the annual amount matches actually that, because, like, we're actually giving them more than that. \nZafreen Arefy:\nYeah. Cause then that's a poor experience when you have to collect funds from them at the end of the year, because they're like, Oh, just kidding. Because yeah. \nEmilyBruns:\nYeah. So in my mind, like. I think your system is really doing the simple math here, this times 12 divided by 26, whereas your medical pre or medical post tax deductions is actually doing the math. For their premium amount, times, the months of coverage they're expected to have divided by the pay periods remaining. And that's how the medical pre amounts or post amounts are actually accurate. But your employer medical is not functioning that same way. Yeah. \nZafreen Arefy:\nI don't know what a quick solution would be. \nEmilyBruns:\nYeah, because our last pay period, we get paid on the 26th. I have to process payroll on Monday. So like, I needed to have this information and like, update it via an EIB, like and have it to my payroll team by Friday. Yeah. Because this shows up on W-2s, like as an employer. Provided coverage. That's why I'm trying to reconcile it, for sure, for sure. \nZafreen Arefy:\nUm, right, I wonder if we connect with Mateo, and, yeah, yeah, go ahead. \nRyan Hanchett:\nUm, I would say we should probably pull in Caroline as well. Um, get somebody from servicing in this. Um, it's more familiar with their customer reporting. Because, yeah, I think there are a lot of things that we could do in the future to try and make this better. It's not going to solve this immediate problem. \nZafreen Arefy:\nYeah. \nRyan Hanchett:\nLike, when we're running payroll, we could, you know, do some additional math. But to get these numbers lined up, I think we probably want to get. Line involved. \nZafreen Arefy:\nOkay, that sounds good. Okay, so a couple of things, then. I'm going to put a working group together with several of us over the next two days. Emily, you need this by Friday at the latest, correct? \nEmilyBruns:\nLike, really Thursday night because Friday I have to complete my EIB. \nZafreen Arefy:\nOkay, let me get something on the books. Obviously, we're going to prioritize this. For tomorrow's meeting that we have a regular check-in, do you still want to hold it? \nEmilyBruns:\nI mean, if there's someone that could hop on to at least talk about the other questions that I had and ignore employer medical for this point in time. Okay. \nZafreen Arefy:\nAnd then could you please remind me exactly which ones those are, so I can also see if I can do some background? \nEmilyBruns:\nYeah, I sent you an email, but let me run through one so you can see what I see. I sent you an email earlier today. Just make sure you got it. Let me see. 1159. It was this like long one, with a lot of information. And I said, these are the ones I want to look at tomorrow. Did you get this? Yes. \nZafreen Arefy:\nYep. All right. \nEmilyBruns:\nSo, like, let's look at this first one. Andrea Shipman. This is workday. This is the Thatch report. So she was a rehire. She missed three pay periods of premiums due to the transition. That was my findings. So if I go to her. Andrea Shipman and go to her 2025. She had coverage January through May and then June through December. \nZafreen Arefy:\nYeah, I know the rehires are a little tricky in our system, so I'm not surprised that there are some questions on this person. All right. \nEmilyBruns:\nSo if I look at her. Medical pre-tax deductions. Okay. From the beginning of January to 5-9, which would have been the first pay period in, or, excuse me, the second pay period in May. So 5-16 pay period. We were taking. 247.23, she had a lapse in coverage that we deducted for from the 530, 613, and 627 pay periods. Because of the way it either, like, came over or I'd have to go look at the payroll report specifically and see, like, what you guys were showing, But we didn't start. Deducting for her again until 6-21, which was the 7-11 pay period. So they were missing deductions on our end from these three periods. And I guess I'm just trying to determine, like, this would mean she owes us back that much money. Like, is that accurate based on her coverage? Was there a timing issue? Like, looking at her transition from... Hire to thought like fire to hire like, you know, when did she make her enrollments? Like? Those are the kind of questions I need to know to see, like number one, why didn't I put this in? My answer? Short answer is because she wasn't on the payroll file. number two. Why wasn't she on the payroll file? And then here I am at the end of the year, about to have to take 741 dollars from her at Christmas time. You know, like, Yeah, yeah, that, like, that's the kind of thing I need answers on there, 100 percent, so that's that one. Let me look at this one, too, because she wasn't a rehire. So Arlena Freeman, I look at her medical pre-tax, she had coverage January and February. We deducted $866,000. And then I'm assuming this was the like, correction for her termination adjustment to offset the bi-weekly extra. So if I look at her thatch, it shows on my end. 2025 coverage January-February. She owed $18.75 a month, $18.75 times two months, $37.50. We took $45.45, but your file shows I should have taken $546. Okay. \nZafreen Arefy:\nSo I'm looking at your list and just recognizing it's like, what, 20 folks? Because it takes a little bit of investigation on our end, I don't think that we're going to have enough time on your call tomorrow to go over these one by one. So. What I would love to do is, Ryan, I don't want to volunteer you, But I will need assistance with these to run through these before the call tomorrow. And then Emily, I'll be able to actually walk you through, Or like, I'll have explanations for, like, answers to how much we're actually supposed to be deducting for all of these people. But I want to make sure the time that we have with you is valuable and useful. And I can actually answer these, as opposed to us kind of only being able to get through like one or two of these tomorrow. Does that make sense? \nEmilyBruns:\nYeah, that sounds good. \nZafreen Arefy:\nOkay. \nEmilyBruns:\nCan you, like, just briefly look at that? Like, is there any changes you see for her? Like, I just saw... \nRyan Hanchett:\nIt looks to me, just quickly, that we were notified after making payment for the March coverage. And so that number is actually intended to be billed to Crossroads, I believe, just looking at the notes on the profile. \nEmilyBruns:\nOh. \nRyan Hanchett:\nNot Arlena. So that was just, like, an extra premium that was... Charged prior to us being told that they were off boarded. So our deduction just may not have caught that difference. \nEmilyBruns:\nWhy would her coverage not show that it actually didn't end until March? \nRyan Hanchett:\nIf we ended up not getting it? \nEmilyBruns:\nThat is a good question. Because some of these I am able to figure out by seeing that, oh, well, They terminated in February, but their coverage says it's through March. We had to pay for an extra month. Okay, it makes sense. But, like, clearly this one doesn't show that. \nZafreen Arefy:\nYeah, um, so there's like a couple reasons for that. But this is where I'll have to check in with our, like, uh, finance folks for why they are showing it this way. But I know sometimes it's just because, for some employers, they wanted to accurately show this person truly only had coverage from this month to this month. And so that overage instead is shown on the back end transaction page, as opposed to incorrectly showing that. Even though this person so like there, I. I'm thinking of an example where an employer was like, this person was only with us until February. So they should not, their portal should not show that they had coverage until March. And so that's why, um, we try to err on the side of that way for reporting purposes. \nEmilyBruns:\nUm, and I, I hear you. But that does, respectfully, like, doesn't align with other people, like, if I look at this employee, um, Deborah Russell. She was terminated. Okay, I guess she was. I don't know what her situation was. Maybe she ended her coverage or something. But we only deducted for February. But then it shows that she had coverage through. Oh wait, yeah, no, she was terminated. I thought that said March, April 7th, I would have submitted it. Whenever it went through on you guys's side, we weren't able to end it from the carrier, I'm assuming so her coverage was active through May. So like that makes sense to me. We had to pay for an extra month, but it doesn't show for the other garage to show to you. Yeah. \nZafreen Arefy:\nAnd if I'm being honest, Emily, we've made some meaning like pretty, I would say monumental, but meaningful changes. Like halfway through the year. So it could have just been that for the previous person that you showed, they were just with the old methodology that we're following. And then we realized, like, oh, that's not going to help. And just due to this, the volume of how many people we go through, they just we just didn't clean it up to then reflect it. To March. Does that make sense? Yeah. Yeah, it does. \nEmilyBruns:\nIt just sucks right now. \nZafreen Arefy:\nI know. I know. And I'm so sorry. \nEmilyBruns:\nOkay. So, I mean, hopefully then, for my purposes, you tell me. That's the same situation for most of these people up here in this. Like different font. And then the people down here are people that it's showing we owe them money back. So this could potentially be a similar situation to the employer medical. But like before, I give these people money back that are mostly terminated and one of them's passed away. I need to make sure that's actually correct and we do owe it back to them. Okay, and then, like, I know for a fact, Judith Hardin and Elizabeth Hines, like, had situations on their account. I remember their names coming up continuously. So I don't even think that these numbers are right on your end. \nZafreen Arefy:\nOkay, let me make a note of those two people, so Judith Hardin, Elizabeth Hines. Okay, thank you. Let me check in with those particular to make sure knowing that they had some issues with their accounts. \nEmilyBruns:\nAnd like, I'm venting at this point, like from an employer perspective, like you guys are a facilitator of our plans, like, your numbers should be accurate. I know you guys have made like a lot of improvements, but like, I should be able to trust what you're giving me is right. And like, looking at some of these, I just know they're not. And that's frustrating. \nZafreen Arefy:\nYeah, no, I hear you. And honestly, just keep this feedback coming, because it's unless people speak up about it, we're not going to know how to fix it. And why it's a problem. And I apologize that you guys end up feeling the most of this tension and frustration because we absolutely do not want it to be this case. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. \nEmilyBruns:\nOkay. So, recap, you're going to look at these and hopefully have some answers by tomorrow. For the employer medical, you guys are going to work internally to figure out how you can provide me accurate numbers that I can reconcile. Yes. And we're clear that I have a hard deadline of, like Thursday night. \nZafreen Arefy:\nYeah, and that's Eastern time. \nEmilyBruns:\nYes, five o'clock. Yep. Okay. All right. Well, we shall chat soon. \nZafreen Arefy:\nSounds good, Emily. Thank you for your patience. Thank you so much. \nEmilyBruns:\nI really do appreciate you hopping on a call. And thank you too, Ryan. Of course. \nRyan Hanchett:\nHappy to help. \nEmilyBruns:\nAll right. Bye guys. Bye. \n",

KEY POINTS DISCUSSED\n\nCurrent Situation\n- Company Profile: Small business, open for 1 year, currently structured as LLC with plans to restructure into S-Corp with trust/holding company structure\n- Current Insurance: UnitedHealthcare through Surest platform\n- Current Enrollment: 3 active employees (owners) + 1 employee under 16 (dependent of owner)\n- Current Cost: Approximately $3,000/month ($1,000 per person) for 3 enrollees\n- Pain Point: High cost with minimal utilization - \"nobody uses it\"\n- Growth Plans: Planning to hire additional employees in 2026\n\nInterest in ICHRA\n- Primary Motivation: Cost reduction and more efficient benefits management\n- Initial Research: Laura was familiar with HSAs from previous employment and sought similar tax-advantaged options\n- Discovery: Found Thatch while researching alternatives to traditional group health insurance\n\nICHRA Model Education\n- Key Limitation Identified: ICHRA not available for LLC/S-Corp owners (only C-Corp owners qualify due to pass-through entity tax treatment)\n- Solution Presented: Owners would purchase plans on the exchange independently; employees can use ICHRA\n- Potential Restructuring Impact: If company converts to C-Corp, all employees including owners could participate in ICHRA\n- Allowance Flexibility: Employer sets pre-tax budget; employees choose individual plans from ~5 carriers with 20+ plan options per zip code\n- Budget Mechanics: \n  - Monthly allowance builds up if unused\n  - Can be used for qualified medical expenses (FSA-like)\n  - Unused funds at year-end return to employer\n  - Employees can buy plans over/under budget (payroll deduction for overages)\n\nPricing Structure\n- Platform Fee: $45 per employee per month (PEPM) - only for enrolled employees\n- Compliance Fee: $50 per month (flat, not per employee)\n- Payroll Integration: SurePayroll (current provider) - compatible with Thatch\n\nPlan Options & Support\n- Average Availability: ~5 carriers with 20+ plan options per zip code\n- Employee Support: Tech platform with plan recommendation algorithm + concierge team (plan support specialists)\n- Wellness Perks: Optional partnerships with vendors (HIMS, mental health coaches, etc.) for unused allowance dollars\n- Geographic Advantage: Distributed team (Texas/Florida) benefits from carrier diversity across states\n\n2. STAKEHOLDERS IDENTIFIED\n\nProspect Company (Contour Body Imaging)\n- Laura Losetti (Losetti): Primary contact, administrative role, started August 2025\n  - Responsibilities: Benefits research, vendor evaluation, implementation coordination\n  - Decision-making authority: Appears to have autonomy but coordinates with owners\n  \n- Company Owners (3 total): \n  - At least one owner located in Florida\n  - Currently enrolled in UnitedHealthcare\n  - Final decision-makers on company structure (LLC vs. C-Corp) and benefits strategy\n  \n- Employee (1): Under 16 years old, dependent of owner\n\nThatch Team\n- Taryn Livingstone: Business Team representative, handles companies <20 employees\n  - Responsibilities: Discovery, education, quote generation, implementation support\n  - Based in New York (company HQ in Austin, Texas)\n\n3.

Entity Structure Clarification (Early in call): Laura revealed company is LLC planning S-Corp restructuring - critical for ICHRA eligibility determination\n2. ICHRA Limitation Disclosure: Taryn transparently explained owners cannot use ICHRA under current LLC structure, but positioned as \"extra feather in the cap\" for C-Corp consideration\n3. Pricing Transparency: Laura confirmed understanding of allowance model where employees can exceed budget via payroll deduction\n4. Urgency Acknowledgment: Laura recognized tight timeline but expressed confidence: \"I have time to do this. I can have everything in order by Friday if we need to.\"\n5. Action Commitment: Laura committed to same-day actions (review plans, check UnitedHealthcare cancellation terms, build quote)\n\n4. NEXT STEPS WITH DEADLINES\n\nImmediate Actions - Laura Losetti (By End of Day, December 16, 2025)\n1. Review Available Plans: Visit thatch.com/plans to spot-check plan options for Texas zip code\n2. Contact UnitedHealthcare: Determine cancellation terms and notice requirements for current policy\n3. Create Thatch Account: Go to thatch.com, click \"Start Now\" to access allowance calculator (no-strings-attached account)\n4. Build Quote Scenario: Use allowance calculator to model costs for current + projected 2026 hires\n5. Owner Coordination: Send information to Florida-based owner for review and discussion\n\nThatch Follow-Up - Taryn Livingstone (December 16, 2025)\n1. Send Follow-Up Email containing:\n   - Links to thatch.com/plans and enrollment portal\n   - Timeline/deadline information (December 20, 2025 for 1/1/2026 coverage)\n   - Additional educational resources\n   - Contact information for questions\n\nDecision Point - Contour Body Imaging (By Friday, December 20, 2025)\n1. Finalize Entity Structure Decision: Determine if C-Corp conversion is feasible/desirable for ICHRA participation\n2. Complete Enrollment: If moving forward, submit employee information and allowance selections through Thatch platform\n3. Cancel UnitedHealthcare: Provide required notice to current carrier (pending terms review)\n\nContingency Planning\n- If December 20 Deadline Missed: Laura acknowledged they have current coverage, so missing 1/1/2026 start date is not catastrophic\n- Alternative Start Dates: Could potentially target later 2026 implementation if needed\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES\n\nOpen Questions/Considerations\n- UnitedHealthcare cancellation terms unknown (30-day notice requirement TBD)\n- Final decision on LLC vs. C-Corp structure pending owner discussion\n- Exact number of 2026 hires not specified (growth plans mentioned but not quantified)\n- Current employee's eligibility unclear (under 16, may be dependent rather than W-2 employee)\n\nCompetitive Positioning\n- Current cost: ~$1,000/person/month with low utilization\n- Thatch positioning: Cost control through individual plan selection + unused allowance flexibility\n- Key differentiator: Geographic flexibility for distributed team (Texas/Florida)\n\nProspect Sentiment\n- Engagement Level: High - Laura was attentive, asked clarifying questions, committed to immediate action\n- Urgency: Moderate-to-high - recognizes timeline but has fallback (current coverage continues)\n- Objections: None raised; primary concern was understanding mechanics and eligibility\n- Likelihood to Close: Moderate - depends on UnitedHealthcare cancellation terms and owner alignment on entity structure"

Oh, and your first name is Laura? Okay, gosh, I was gonna say, I've never. I've never heard the name Losetti before. That's such a cool first name. \nloset:\nI don't know how that happened. I think it's because my email is l-o-s-e-t-e or something. So that could be. Could be. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, there you go. Yeah. Nice. Well, that's awesome. I'm Taryn. It's nice to meet you. Quick intro. I'm on the business team here at Thatch. So mainly work with companies less than 20 employees, which is why we are talking today. But anywho, you're calling in from Texas, right? \nloset:\nYep. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nNice. Very cool. We actually are based in Austin. \nloset:\nMyself, I'm in New York. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nBut yeah, the HQ is not too, too far. That's fine. Right. Yeah. But anyway, so also to preface with this call, really, I am just looking to learn more about what you're higher thinking about, benefits, insurance, that sort of thing, And what sparked your interest in Thatch. And then we can probably kick it off from there. And then we'll see if we'll be able to help on our ends. \nloset:\nSo we have currently have UnitedHealthcare. We only have three employees that are active on it. I think we're with Surest, which is like their small business platform. So with January coming, we're just looking to see if we're growing and hiring. So it's like, you kind of need to offer it to everybody. So, but we're just we're new. We've been open a year. So we've never offered insurance to the company before, so we're trying to hold on. No. Okay. So, Tristan, can you close that door for me, please? Hold on. Let's see. I don't know if you can still hear me. I can. No. Okay. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nHold on. Hold on. \nloset:\nSo I can't hear you anymore because my headset died. So hold on. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nSpeakers. \nloset:\nOkay. I should be able to hear you now. All right. Sorry. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOkay. Perfect. Testing one, two, three. \nloset:\nYeah. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nGot it. \nloset:\nGot it. Got it. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nLovely. Lovely. \nloset:\nSo we've been open a year. Basically, the owners are the only ones on the insurance right now. So we have four. Well, technically we have four, but one of our employees is under 16. So they're under the parent. So, but that's currently what we have. So we needed something right away. So that's kind of why I just that's the first thing I went to. And so now I have time to kind of like, look around and see. And it's like something a little bit more cost effective because we're paying. Eight times three, like almost three thousand dollars a month for the three of us, four of us, and we don't use insurance, nobody uses it. So it's like, you know, I don't know. I was just looking, yeah. So I was like, if I could just put money in a savings account for them, that if they ever did get set, they would use. But that's not something we can do. So I was like, well, we'll figure out what we can do. So that's where you guys came in. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nAll right. Perfect. Yeah. Thanks for writing the context there. So it sounds like. All right. Four employees, two of which are the owners. I'm assuming three owners. OK. \nloset:\nOwners. One. Yeah. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nThree owners and one dependent. Oh, I see. OK, so. Right, right, because the 16-year-old is one of the dependents of the owners. Yes, okay. So, and I'm assuming, are you guys, do you know how you're taxed? Are you, like, an S-corp, C-corp? \nloset:\nWe are currently, well, come January, he wants us, well, so we're building a trust. We're going to have an S-corp, but this company is just an LLC. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nGotcha. Okay. \nloset:\nSo I'm not sure, and maybe that's something you can guide me. Would the insurance go? I think the insurance has to go through the LLC, not the S Corp. The S Corp. would just be like the, would be the trust for the management company type thing. So I think it would go through the LLC. So I know I have to talk it through. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah. I'm talking it through. Yeah, I know. Totally. I know this stuff is confusing. Okay. So I mainly wanted to ask that actually, because, and I wanted to make sure I clarify this upfront. So with an ICHRA, how familiar are you with, with the IchRA model? Okay. \nloset:\nNot at all, because I hadn't, I just started working here, like in August, and I had an HSA with my previous job and loved it. So I've got like seven grand banked up into this thing. And I, and my husband's like, can't we get something them like that. And I'm like, no, because you have to have a... I don't see where if we're the ones paying for it, if it's really cost benefit to have an HSA. So that's kind of where I started looking is something similar, but not that we could do, if that makes sense. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, totally makes sense. OK, so we so. Icra like long acronym, but stands for individual coverage health reimbursement Arrangement. And so. I can walk you through what that means, But basically, it means that you are giving people an HRA, which is a health reimbursement account, to buy an individual plan on the ACA. Now, with us, it's not actually on the ACA because we partner directly with healthcare carriers to offer plans. And because we do that, we are able to actually do the off-exchange version of the plans, which means that they can be purchased from both the employee contribution and employer contribution pre-tax. So it's a pre-tax benefit in that regard, right? So now here's the issue, though, when it comes to ownership. So ICRAs, this model, it's not available for owners of anything other than a C-Corp exclusively. And the reason why is because it's a, it's a pass-through entity, right? For LLCs and S-Corps. So technically, the insurance right can already be included as a business expense for the owners of the company. So that's like the little nuance there now it is still. Obviously we work with many companies that aren't C-Corps. Um, so basically what we do in these situations is. The owner would go to the exchange to buy their plans and just not use the Icra. But all of their employees can use the Icra to then get their insurance. So that is still an option, especially because you mentioned that you're that you're planning to hire. Um, this year so, but just wanted to be up front though. \nloset:\nThe owner, No, that's fine. Yeah, I kind of need to know that's perfect. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOkay, great, um, okay. So I think what we could do with our time here then is I can give you a quick rundown of, just like Thatch, how the acre model works, that sort of thing. So you have, like all of the basically all the information that you need. In terms of okay, here's what this would look like if we were. \nloset:\nI mean, because we're not stuck in the LLC, right? We're about to restructure anyway. So, like it may, yeah. I mean, if it's more beneficial to do a C-Corp versus anything else, cause the S-Corp would be the holding company. So, yeah, I mean. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOkay. Yeah. Well, then this, then, yeah, treat this as an extra like feather, if you will, in the cap of maybe I'll doing it, going to the C-Corp route. What I'll show you now is here, I'll dive into the deck. And this is just going to give you again, more of an overview of that, how we work, and then. After that, I'll show you how you can actually use the tool to get a better estimate of, like, what the actual cost would be if you hire employees. And so to do that here, can you see my screen? Yep. Okay, perfect. So to kick it off here with the deck. So at Thatch, our mission is to build a health care system people love. So how do we do that? Well, right now, so generally speaking, especially for small employers. Healthcare tends to be this one size fits all model that doesn't actually fit everyone very well. So, for instance, if you might have some people in the group who don't use their insurance. While other people use it a lot and might be pretty expensive, you're going to have the premiums go up year over year, even if not everyone is using the insurance. Right. That's one issue that we see a lot. Similarly, especially as you're hiring, if anyone has a particular network or doctor that they really need to see for some reason. Then they might have to actually switch networks if they're joining your company. If you have just one carrier with one to three plan options, right? How small group usually works. So for those reasons, it kind of ends up being this like lose-lose scenario, which is where us as a company comes into play with the ICRA. So ICRA, I know we just covered it, but individual coverage, health reimbursement Arrangement. Basically, what that means is that you as an employer can set this pre-tax budget for your employees to then first buy their medical plan on. And then if they do have any leftover funds from that budget, they can use that very similarly to an FSA account, meaning that anything that's a qualified medical expense, like prescriptions or even buying a mental health or telehealth vendor online, could count towards that qualified medical expense dollars there. And then also, too, this is a monthly budget. So if they did have any leftover, it would just stay on their card. This is like where the account comes into play. So this budget would build up month over month. But if at the end of the year they have money they don't spend, that would actually just go back to you as the employer. So it's more like you're setting the budget. People then use that how they want. They can go under budget if they want to, or they can go over budget. So, say, this employee bought a plan that was $1,000 a month, right? But the budget was only $750. In that case, what would happen is you would just simply connect your payroll provider. Do you know which one you're planning on using? \nloset:\nNo, we use, right now we just use SurePayroll because it's, we're not that complicated. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOkay, nice. Yeah, perfect. So, so basically, how it would work is you would just simply connect your payroll. So we, we were, we've done some with SurePayroll before, I believe. We also, it's a very easy. Process, though, basically you just like, upload your employee list and it would all be set to go there. So how it would work is when your employee is getting paid, they would actually have. The deduction comes directly from their payroll to then pay for their plan if they were to buy a plan that's over budget. So very similar to Group Um, also pre-tax there, too for the employee contribution. Awesome, yeah, any questions on how this works? \nloset:\nNope, I'm good, all right. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nLet's breeze on through. So. This is just giving you a little bit of, like, a viewpoint on the offerings we have at Thatch. So for any Zip code, on average, we have around five carriers with over 20 plan options. So employees basically have more optionality than ever before in terms of who they want to go with for their healthcare. But with more options, obviously means that we also want to make sure they're supported to make the best decision possible. So that's again where we come in as a tech platform, first and foremost. So what we'll take into account is who somebody's doctor is, what medications they're on, basically information of that nature. To recommend a plan that is a good fit for them. But then also we have a full-blown concierge team who are plan support specialists that they can hop on the phone with as they're going through the selection process there, too. All right. Any questions on support, that sort of thing? All right, great. So this actually is an extra perk that we have made here at Thatch. This is really building off this idea of these extra spending dollars that can be put toward healthcare. So we went out and made individual partnerships with all of the vendors listed here, mainly to find ways in which we can help to support people on health and wellness journeys that are outside of just insurance. So. This actually comes into play a lot, especially if you do hire some folks who either are younger. Or just simply, you know, don't need a very beefy insurance plan so that they'll say, buy down and maybe get like a bronze plan. What they can do then is if they have an extra $100 a month, they could get HIMS, they could buy mental health coach, whatever that might be. So just an extra add on there if you and something you can turn on and off. So you don't necessarily have to offer this, but definitely an option. All right. Very lastly. Just the nuts and bolts. So, basically, you can think of Thatch as an end-to-end medical benefits platform. So we will cover everything from helping with employees enroll in the plans, through the compliance, so making sure the plans are all good to go. With. Reporting on the ACA, all the way through to receipt verification. So this comes into play. If someone buys something at Walgreens and they want to expense it, they can just submit their receipt to Thatch, and we'll take care of that straight from their budget. And then also payroll deductions, which we already covered earlier, basically making so the employee's contribution is automatically deducted there. All right. That's pretty much everything. So really, as far as all this goes, like what we do here at that, just make it so that you as the employer just need to focus on one thing mainly, which is setting those allowances once a year. \nloset:\nAnd then how do we decide what the allowance should be? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOh, it's a great question. Actually, it's a perfect transition. Yeah. Okay. All right. So we'll jump over here really quickly. And then I'm also going to show you, and I'll send this to you also in a follow-up. But if you go to Thatch.com slash plans, this is actually how you can spot check which plans are available for your area. So you can just put in your info here, a Zip code that's relevant, and it will show what the plan options look like. So very useful tool before like fully going through the full blown quote process. But to show you what the quote process looks like, because it's not too hard. So this page here you get to simply. But when you go to that dot com and then click Start now, it will bring you to this page after a couple other clicks to get here. And so what you're looking at right now is the two ways to upload employees. So you can upload a list. So just dragging the CSV file in here, or you can manually do it. It's pretty simple to do. You just put in the information about each employee and then it's all good to go, hit next step to go through. We'll just give you back some info, we're using San Francisco as an example Zip code, but again, you can with your information. It'll show Yeah, yeah, so Texas, all right, okay, so on this screen here. So now this is showing you the two ways of doing allowances. So first way is a flat dollar amount for everybody, so very straightforward. Everyone gets the same allowance for their health care. The only issue this can cause, though, is if you have somebody who's younger versus older, for instance, the same dollar amount is going to get the younger person a lot further than the older person, Just given that plans are more expensive the older you get. Right. So we also have this calculator over here for smart allowances. So what we do as a company is we'll take into account where someone lives. So there's Zip code. How old they are and how many dependents? They have to recommend a plan, um, basically a plan allowance that's going to be best for them. And so this is basically our way of doing it compliantly. Usually you can't pick and choose how much each person gets, but doing it like this is a good way to tier it a little bit. So, all right, this is going to be kind of a lot, but we'll go through each part of it. So first off, um, we'll start with the same dollar amount for everybody. So, again, pretty straightforward. We're just going to set the allowance here for what every employee gets. So let's say $500. And then, if they have a first dependent, we can also make that up a little. So, let's say first dependent is $200. Additional dependents is $100, right? What that will do then is it's then going to assign, based on the number of dependents, the dollar amount that they would get. And so one thing to flag here, this little exclamation point, basically, it looks like it looks like it's a problem. It's actually not. So this is just saying that, oh, hey, This allowance is unaffordable, given that, based on where Bob Smith lives and how old he is, it would be considered an unaffordable allowance. That's only going to matter if the company is a large employer, so over 50 employees. So you can kind of not pay any attention to that. It won't matter. The only thing it will cause, though, is if you do have anybody who qualifies for a subsidy. They could decline coverage with you if the allowance is unaffordable and you use the subsidy instead. Kind of a bit of a long explanation there for why we have that little check in place, but just want to make sure. \nloset:\nNo, and that's fine. So if, let's say the premium is more than the allowance, is that allowed? Like, they would have to pay the extra amount out of a payroll deduction, or is that not allowed? Exactly. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah. So here's a good example of it. Right. So if we... If Bob buys this plan, for instance, right, Bob is going to pay $330 on his end. Now, there's some plans that are more cheaper, right? We only pay like $30, but that's exactly how it would work. \nloset:\nOkay. All right. I just wanted to make sure it would be okay that they got it. I got it. Yeah, totally. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nAnd then. Basically, this also, by the way, what you're seeing here is pretty similar to what employees will see when they're signing up. It's also going to be a very similar view to that Thatch Plans page I mentioned before, where it'll let you filter by platinum plans, gold plans, different insurance companies, that sort of thing, to find something that might fit someone best. So last thing I'll show you here, smart allowance. So what this is doing is it's saying, okay, coverage level wise. Do you want to offer a lowest cost, meaning like bronze plan, Best fit for you, silver, better benefits, gold plan to your employees? And then, based on what you want to offer them, what do you want your contribution to be? So I'm going to go over here to custom real quick. So what this is showing actually is basically, if you want to cover 100% for silver plans, this would be the amount you should give everybody at the company. Now, if you wanted to cover, say, 50% of silver plans, then you could just put this down to 50% And then those allowances would adjust down there. And so because like, this isn't like a traditional insurance, where normally you'd pick like a carrier and like a silver plan. \nloset:\nAnd that would just kind of be it. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nRight. This is, this is instead showing you. I want to contribute 50% of the silver plans available to my employees. \nloset:\nAnd then you go, choose what you want. Yeah. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nExactly. Yeah, you got it. So they could buy down, they could buy up. Yeah, you got it. Okay. \nloset:\nPerfect. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nAll right. That's pretty much everything I wanted to. Also, yeah, I know I'm breezing right along. Any other questions I can help to clarify? \nloset:\nNo, because I, no, I'm fine. I'm fine. I get it. Cool. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOkay. Then, very lastly, fees on our end. So we charge a $45 per employee per month fee. So PEPM kind of similarly to what brokers will charge for insurance, only for enrolled employees, though. So, for instance, say, you know, for a fact, Carol is going to decline. You can just uncheck that and then it would better reflect what the cost would be here. Yeah. And then also a $50 compliance fee that is per month. But not per employee. \nloset:\nOkay. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nAnd yeah, that's just about everything. \nloset:\nAwesome. Okay. So I'm going to go on batch plans and then look and see what's available in the area. And we go from there, right? Precisely. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah. So you can go run over to plans, put in some info and see what's available. And then, basically, what the next step would look like is, so if you wanted to move forward with that, I think I've maybe forgot to ask, Are you looking for a 1-1 coverage start date or later 1-1? \nloset:\nUh, well, I don't know I because I wasn't paying attention when I signed up with United. So I don't know if I have to give them 30 days or I don't know because 1-1 restarts our plan. I don't, I have to look and see what they say. But yes, I would be thinking 1-1 would be what we would be looking for. Okay, perfect. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nSo, basically... Great. So, so basically, like we, so we're a little on a time crunch for one, one, but not, not a bad one. Yeah, I know. \nloset:\nI know. I mean, we have insurance, so it won't kill me if, like, I don't know. I don't know how you can get out. I don't know how that works. So that's the one thing I have to look into and see. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, you can just, I believe you can just contact the carrier and you'd be able to figure out a path out. I think that's what most people will do. \nloset:\nYeah, I'm going to do that. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. But, um. Okay. But yes. So as far as next steps go, so the deadline to sign up for one, one coverage for employers is Friday. So I know it's right around the corner. It's coming right on up. \nloset:\nCause I have time to do this. So I'll do that today. I'll figure out what I can do and look at the plans and stuff and see, but I can definitely, I can have everything in order by Friday if we need to. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nAll right. Perfect. Yeah. That's, that's awesome. Oh yeah. No, sorry. But my, my internet connection, just like, went in and out and you're back. Okay. Perfect. There we go. All right. I'm a little bit on a lag, so excuse the lag there, but perfect. Yeah. In that case, so two things that you'll do then, um, number one, check out the plan. So you just have, again, this is just going to give you so that you have peace of mind over what your employees are actually going to be offered. If you were to write higher folks and bring them on. \nloset:\nYeah. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nAnd then, um, and then the other thing too is, go to thatch.com, click Start now. It will prompt you to make an account. It's a no strings attached account, though. Really, that's just going to get you to the allowance calculator. Once you're there, you can start to actually play around with allowances and then actually see more likely. OK, if we were to hire this many people this year, here's what the cost could be. That sort of thing. \nloset:\nOK, that's perfect. Yeah, because. Yeah. A lot of balls in the air. So because if we would have to, since it's the owners on the plan currently, we would have to go ahead and switch everybody over to a C Corp. All right. So let me, let me, let me see what we're we're going to do. But, yeah, that's I'm going to go into plans and then the start now to build the thing so I can look. I got it. I got it. I got amazing. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah. Hit the nail on the head. All right. Great. So I, in that case, I'll send over a quick follow-up email. That'll just have, again, all of the links. I kind of just. In one spot. Yes. And as well as some more info, all that good stuff. And if you do need me, feel free to reach out. I'll also include the timeline on there too, just so that you have that in mind. And that's good. \nloset:\nCause one of my, one of the owners is in Florida, so I can send it to him. And we can kind of go over everything and see how that's due. Okay. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nPerfect. Yeah. Well, that's actually also very good. As far as a Nicro goes, we usually do find that. If the team's distributed, most likely they're going to want different carriers. Just because not all carriers in all states are created equal. Yeah, exactly. Okay, great. \nloset:\nAll right. Thank you so much. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nNice to meet you. \nloset:\nGreat to meet you too. Merry Christmas. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYou too. Bye. \n",

Key Points Discussed\n\n   - Employer Interest & Background: Hidden Harvest Corporation initially sought QSEHRA in early October 2025 but required a class-based structure, leading to ICHRA consideration. The Board of Directors approved a benefits structure, but it was non-compliant with IRS regulations. The target implementation is January 2026 for 4 active employees.\n\n   - Compliance Issues Identified: The Board approved tiering based on job titles, which is not permissible under ICHRA regulations. Compliant alternatives include tiering based on age, ZIP code, and number of dependents. There are 11 eligible class options, including full-time vs. part-time employees and salaried vs. hourly employees.\n\n   - Platform Features Discussed: The allowance calculator automatically tiers allowances based on compliant variables. Thatch offers pre-tax payroll deductions and a real-time view of buying power and plan options for each employee.\n\n2. Identification of Stakeholders\n\n   - Internal (Thatch/Broker Team):\n     - Joseph Firenzi (Joe Firenzi): Thatch Sales Representative responsible for product education, compliance guidance, and enrollment support.\n     - Josh Fitzpatrick: Broker/Benefits Advisor (Paychex, Inc.) acting as an intermediary between the employer and Thatch, responsible for client communication and meeting coordination.\n\n   - External (Prospect):\n     - Hidden Harvest Corporation: Employer/Prospect with the Board of Directors as the approval authority for the benefits structure.\n\n3. Important Milestones & Timestamps\n\n   - Historical Timeline:\n     - Early October 2025: Initial conversation about QSEHRA; ICHRA introduced as an alternative.\n     - October-December 2025: Extended approval process through the Board of Directors.\n     - Week of December 16, 2025: Board approval received with a non-compliant structure.\n\n   - Critical Moments in Conversation (December 16, 2025):\n     - Compliance issue identified by Joe.\n     - Educational pivot with IRS-compliant class structure resource shared.\n     - Census data gap identified.\n     - Enrollment deadline extension provided for January 2026 implementation.\n\n4. Next Steps with Deadlines & Responsible Parties\n\n   - Immediate Actions (Week of December 16, 2025):\n     - Josh Fitzpatrick:\n       - Contact Hidden Harvest about the non-compliant class structure.\n       - Request clean census data including employee names, ages, ZIP codes, and number of dependents.\n       - Send introductory email looping in Joe Firenzi and Hidden Harvest contact.\n       - Coordinate meeting scheduling between all parties.\n\n     - Joseph Firenzi:\n       - Respond with a calendar link for meeting scheduling.\n       - Conduct presentation if the employer is available.\n       - Send IRS-compliant class structure resource document.\n       - Prepare to demonstrate ICHRA functionality on the Thatch platform.\n\n   - Meeting Agenda (To Be Scheduled):\n     - Present ICHRA overview and Thatch platform capabilities.\n     - Demonstrate allowance calculator with compliant class structures.\n     - Review eligible class options and recommend structure.\n     - Show plan options"

Um, sorry, I just caught up on that email thread we had going. Um, I realized that you added another question there that I didn't get to. But things have been pretty busy for us during open enrollment. So sorry about that. \nJosh Fitzpatrick:\nNo, that's okay. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nUm, Yeah, I was catching up on that. And if I'm understanding correctly, it looks like this is a group of three people where two are on a small group plan and then one is Medicare eligible now. And then it sounds like those two people will be staying on that group plan and they are not interested in going on thatch. Is that right? \nJosh Fitzpatrick:\nYeah, and that one's actually OK. We found an alternative so that they went a different direction. So that one's actually all good. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nThat entire account is all good? \nJosh Fitzpatrick:\nYeah, yeah. They're all set. Oh, okay. Yeah, she just set up like a traditional hra because she was looking to have something in place by January. So that one's all good. But the new one that I have, that's definitely something we're going to need to get set up. Okay, cool. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nI just wanted to add like, one more last note there. So, like, generally, if, you know, Medicare isn't a factor, let's highlight another example where there's a team of, let's say, three people. One of them goes on a spouse's plan at a different business. If they do that and decline the coverage with thatch, we actually do not offer the FSA allowance by itself. So typically, in order to have any kind of health reimbursement funds, you do need to enroll in some kind of plan with thatch. And since this was a use case of just one person getting Medicare and then looking for supplemental funds, um, I've never encountered an account like that yet. So that would have been a very new use case. I would have had to check with our operations team to see if we could have supported that. And I have a feeling they would say it's not a good fit. So yeah. \nJosh Fitzpatrick:\nYeah. Anything for her was tough in general, because she was just on Medicare. So it was like, I guess I found out, like even other alternatives, I guess I did find out that. Like just a traditional HRA, like if you have Medicare accounts as like a secondary. Technically, if you don't have the group, if you are on the group health insurance, you could take advantage of it still if you're on Medicare. So that's the way that they went. But uh, yeah, no, that was a weird situation. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nSo well, I'm glad she got a solution in place. So that's good. Yeah, yeah, but yeah, what's the uh name of this new account? \nJosh Fitzpatrick:\nSo it's give me one sec and sorry for this one. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nDid you, uh, submit a request in the Thatch like broker portal, or did you just for a quote? \nJosh Fitzpatrick:\nYeah, yeah, I did. yeah, I think I did it right. I went in there, just I put the name in there. It's it's Hidden Harvest Corporation. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nOkay, yeah, let me see what I can find. That name sounds familiar, so I think that might have, yeah, it was a weird one. \nJosh Fitzpatrick:\nShe, uh, hidden harvest. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nOkay, yeah, Cassandra put me in touch. Okay, yeah, she. \nJosh Fitzpatrick:\nuh. So just give you some background. Yeah, she, uh. I talked to her like this had to be maybe early October. And she wanted the Q, Sarah, And then she wanted to class it out, though. So I brought up the Ichra to her. So then it was like a long process because she had, they have, like, a board of directors. So they had to go get it approved. And I don't know, did you see, do you have that document that I sent you with the approval? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nI can resend it. \nJosh Fitzpatrick:\nI think I, I'm not sure if I sent it over. Let's see. But yeah, basically she's got the approval with all the classes. Let's see. That's for I even can obviously her with you. I wanted to talk to you first and see how we should go about it. Afford this to you. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nCool, yeah, I'm just pulling up, uh, some documents from Cassandra. This might be what you're sending me. \nJosh Fitzpatrick:\nYeah, I just forwarded you the email that she sent me, she said. I think the QSarA because this is what the board approved and see attached, but it's not. It's a. It's a necro because there's classes broken out. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nSo I actually, yeah, is it just here? I can share my screen super quickly? I think I found it. Is this the document? \nJosh Fitzpatrick:\nYep, that's it okay. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nSo, yeah, one thing I see right away here is that you cannot tier classes, uh, based on job title alone, so here it says leadership team and then full-time staff. So, you know, with the IcRa allowance, that is, of course, pre-tax dollars. And then you can't just give people more pre-tax funds because of their position, unfortunately. So it does need to be based on age, ZiP code and number of dependents when tiering out the allowances. So that's one thing there. So I don't know if this is like a long approval process. Hopefully not with, like, getting approved by the board. But we have this allowance calculator that I can show you today if you want. It's pretty handy for going through all this, but there can still be a lot of flexibility with the amount you give someone. But it's designed to just help people out that have more expensive plans due to them being older, like having children and stuff like that. \nJosh Fitzpatrick:\nYeah, so they can't class out based on... I guess, so employment, like, they can't separate managers? Yeah. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nHere, we actually have this cool resource here. I'll send you in the Zoom chat. So here's the 11 eligible classes. You can do full-time versus part-time. So, in other words, you can do... For all full-time people, you give them like 700 a month, all part-time get 350 a month. You can do salary and hourly in the same structure. Um, and then all these different ones here. Yes, okay, that's about it. \nJosh Fitzpatrick:\nSo it's really just separating, like full-timers, part-timers, and then hourly and correct, and then, um. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYou're also not required to present an allowance to part-time people if you do not want to. Um, so you are compliant if you exclude them, but okay, um, oh yeah. The other one, I forget how they word it here. Oh, the same region. They should have just said geography or something like that. But another eligible class is state-based. So, for example, you could have one flat allowance for everyone in California, and then a different one for Texas, because it's more affordable in Texas. \nJosh Fitzpatrick:\nOkay. Is that based on ZIP code or state? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nIdeally, state for like, if you're going to class it out and like, tier the allowances. And then a calculator kind of does that automatically, though. I'll show you what that looks like. Do you have any census data for this group? \nJosh Fitzpatrick:\nYes, I do. And I can send that over. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nOkay. And are they trying to get started in January? We still have some time left, and we actually just extended our enrollment deadline. So there's some extra time now. \nJosh Fitzpatrick:\nYeah, I was going to give her a call today after I talked to you, or schedule a meeting with her. But I'll need to get, like, a cleaner census, because, I thought. I didn't think she was going to, I didn't, I didn't heard back from her. And then she literally just emailed me, like this week, and was like, Hey, the board approved this. Like, can we get started on this? So it was a, yeah, but I wanted to talk to you first. So I got to let her know, though. Like, she can't even class it out that way. So I assume that's going to be just going to go have to go back on that. Let me see. Yeah, I'll have to get, I mean, right now I have four employees that are active, so I'll have to go back and get her. Like a clean census with the dependents on it, but I can do that today. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nOkay. Yeah. And luckily my calendar has, you know, it's slowed down a little bit, so I have more openings, So we should be able to find something. I can send you my calendar link like right after this call. But for these smaller groups, this is generally the flow I go through. I generally do like a presentation to outline how ICHR is function on thatch with our platform and everything. And then after that, I pivot to this, which is the allowance calculator. This is actually the real sign-up experience, by the way. So after that call on Zoom, I send them a link for them to input their account information. And then eventually, they'll progress to this page with the calculator. They'll see all their employees. And then, with the default settings right now, we can see the dynamic calculator come to life. And it's tiering the allowances based on those three variables of age, ZiP code, and number of dependents. And you can adjust it as much as you want. So, in other words, here, you could just say, I want the employee to cover the entire cost that comes with adding dependents to the plan. Or, you could provide some extra financial support to people that have families by choosing something here. You can adjust it at the employee level and do lowest cost, better benefits, or this one in the middle. And then you can also hit this custom slider and move this down to whatever you're happy with. And you can see how much flexibility there is. And then for groups of under 50 people, you don't need to worry about this compliance thing. This only applies to people with over 50 employees. So the other very cool thing as well is that you can click See plans next to each employee. And then get a look at the buying power that you're giving them with your selections and then adjust accordingly, which is pretty awesome for each plan available to them. \nJosh Fitzpatrick:\nAwesome. Do you have, do you get, so you have to get, they have to get a plan off of here. Do people give? What if someone has? Do you get a lot of kickback on that? Like, what if someone already had their own individual plan? Like outside of a, I guess from like, an open market. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nOn like the government exchange. \nJosh Fitzpatrick:\nYeah, yeah. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah, so they can actually, they can import it into Thatch. So that is an option when you create your account. The only restriction there is that if they were receiving an income-based tax subsidy, it would not be eligible to be imported. Because the IRS would consider that double dipping in pre-tax funds. Yeah. Because of the pre-tax dollars that Thatch offers. And then I'll just highlight this as well, since we're on that topic. These green numbers are instances of the current allowance covering the entire cost of this plan in full. And then red numbers are the opposite. So this plan would be a cost sharing scenario where the employee would have to pay $140 with a pre-tax payroll deduction each month. If they were to go on the government exchange, they would actually have to use post-tax dollars. So the pre-tax payroll deduction is something that's actually only available to third party Icra administrators. Off of that government exchange website. \nJosh Fitzpatrick:\nOkay. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nSo that's a major advantage there. Yeah. \nJosh Fitzpatrick:\nYeah. Okay. So just next, like, do we get her on a meeting with us and like, show her all this or do we? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah. \nJosh Fitzpatrick:\nOkay. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah. So we can set up a meeting as soon as possible. I actually have time this afternoon. So just whenever she's soonest available, I'll run through a couple of key slides and won't take too long in that. And then I'll just outline how this calculator functions. And then. Um, I guess, you know, we can center that. That resource I sent you with the eligible classes. But yeah, unfortunately, it's considered, uh, non-compliant to tier it out based on like, leadership position or something like that. \nJosh Fitzpatrick:\nYeah, yeah, okay, so are you? Are you okay with it? So if I loop us all in an email, are you okay with that? And then we schedule a time, um, and we'll. Obviously I'll hop on. Did you want to send the meeting invite to her or should I? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nUh, generally, I just send people my calendar link, because then when they enroll through that or not enroll, they they book through that. It, um, auto populates a bunch of details with like Zoom and stuff that makes it pretty easy. \nJosh Fitzpatrick:\nOh sweet, okay, perfect. And well. I'll send her an email now then, and I'll loop you in, obviously, and I'll just say, Hey, we're gonna, um, schedule a time to go over the Icra options and moving forward with that, so and then we can go from there. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nCool, sound good. And then, um, yeah. I'll just respond to that email with my my calendar link and then let me know if I can help with anything on this one. Sounds like we'll get it to a closed one here, though. \nJosh Fitzpatrick:\nYeah, yeah, should be good. All right, I was watching you, Josh. Looking forward to the next session. Yeah, of course. Thanks. \n",

            "transcript": "Retsy Holliday:\nMore upfront, it needs to be shared earlier on in the sales cycle so that it isn't such a surprise, especially if they have a large Medicare population. And then I really like, I, I think at the end of the day, the workflow itself, Kara, like when you go in and first yes. Creating an account. Like we had one woman at Elco literally sit down and point to the computer and say, I don't, I don't know how to do that. And she's literally talking about opening a computer. Like it is very overwhelming for this population to have to, to find something in their email, click on that link, go create their account. And then from there, the two options, the workflow options are enter this, go your information into this Google form. That's hard. Like I, I sat next to somebody and walked her through how to do that and she had her social security page with her right there in that moment and like had all of the information she needed. She still didn't feel comfortable doing this by herself. And then I think when you bring, if you need to go shopping for a plan, the fact that like, we were on site and then we were like, oh, you're gonna meet with a Medicare agent in four days from now. They were like, no, I don't wanna meet with a Medicare agent in four days from now. I'm here now to get this done and I don't wanna wait. And so I think it's a combination of everything that you said, Kara, but I, you know, those are like the, the bigger buckets that I would say are, are the pain points. The feedback that I have received from multiple brokers now is you need a phone number for the Medicare population. They know how to use a cell phone. They know how to call somebody. That is what they're comfortable doing. Push like multiple people at Elco told us we don't have laptops. So like we set up phone, literally Megan is a fricking rockstar on product. She sat down and downloaded Google Meet on somebody's cell phone so that they could meet with the advisor in four days from when we met with them. But I don't think an anything's gonna come from that. Like they're, they're not able to enter anything onto their phone. They're not, they're confused on how to do that. So I think a phone number is how you solve it for this population. Yeah. \nZach Egan:\nSuper resonant. Yeah. And we are between this group, we are going to have a phone number next year and it is in the works. Amazing. We're not talking about it like making promises now. 'cause that timeline's very TBD, but that's the top priority for Garrity and it's for this exact reason amongst many other reasons. Do I think it'll like solve all of these problems? No, but it'll give them someone who can perhaps direct them on how to do it. I think the most challenging thing that development I've seen as of late is like my personal understanding of how we support the Medicare front was just not correct. Like I, since I began, spoke to our prospects saying, Hey, we help folks enroll in parts A and B, we do not, we can help with like part D and supplementals, but it is on the onus is on the individual. And I think the, the biggest pushback I've heard is like for, for brokers, some of them are equipped to do this. Some feel like it shouldn't be their job. But even for that individual to like, okay, now how do I go to the social security office? Like any guidance that we can provide would be helpful. So what we are working on, I met with the Medicare team. We're gonna have, they're working on a one pager right now that we're gonna send in every single sales cycle. If it's a, a post, you know, follow up email and it's like, Hey, you must read this or this is important at the, at the end of the day though, it doesn't fix everything. We can say like, Hey, we can point back to a piece of paper that said we told you how it was gonna work. Right? So some of it isn't like a thatch problem as much as like, you know, the onus is on them as well to do some education. So we're gonna get better during the sales cycle. But that starts with us fully understanding how we support on that front, which is like honestly been a moving target over the past couple months. So I'll keep working with that team and, and we're gonna have something early January. We can start shipping out there, Dennis, is that true? \nDenis Kalamar:\nYeah, because it's, I think it's, Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, so it's actually not e like not illegal for 65 and above. You can actually still enroll into an a CA plan if you're 65 and older. It's just gonna be more, it's gonna be cheaper if you go to the Medicare route and it's gonna be better benefits. But this is something that Julia and I are seeing for 3G is because the Medicare rep actually kind of screwed up the timing and they're not gonna actually be enrolled into the Medicare plan until the end of January or further. And so in the meantime, he actually enrolled into an a CA plan and he is like 67 and he is doing that for the seven Medicare folks. Oh, interesting. \nRetsy Holliday:\nAs like a stop gap. So like they're actually going to like healthcare.gov signing up for a plan there. They'll reimburse that in the interim until the Medicare plan comes onto the platform and then they can switch it. Are they, is that Exactly, Yeah. Is do you need a qualifying life event to be able to switch from the ac, like the on exchange plan to this Medicare plan Or No. \nDenis Kalamar:\nSo that's what we're trying to figure out right now. The hub Medicare person, like actually enrolled it and he said it should be fine, but, but the issue is, is that if you're enrolled in an a CA plan, like you're in the Medicare enrollment process and then you sign up for an a CA plan that's not legally compliant. But if you don't start the enrollment process, then you can sign up for the a CA plan. Oh, interesting. But don't they need to get their applications in now in order to, It's only six months within the timeframe of when they're Medicare eligible Six, six months previously and six months post. Okay. \nRetsy Holliday:\nHmm. \nDenis Kalamar:\nSo that's why like, I think that just the guidance on kind of what we're saying as sales reps needs to align with kind of like Yeah, because we've been getting called out a few times from Medicare, a hundred percent specific reps. Yeah, yeah, No doubt. \nZach Egan:\nYeah. \nRetsy Holliday:\nSo you're saying My 95-year-old is not gonna be able, this wouldn't work for my 95-year-old since he's been eligible for Medicare for 30 years. \nDenis Kalamar:\nHonestly, like I don't have full like confidence in anything Medicare. Okay. This is like, I'm just like going around the channel. It's like, but I do know 65 and above you can go to the AC marketplace. You don't have to enroll into Medicare if you don't want to. Okay. \nRetsy Holliday:\nAll right. Good to know. \nKara Kubarych:\nAlso, just share, this isn't, this doesn't answer all the questions and definitely a lot more to discuss, but this support page has been updated with some of the FAQs we've been getting during OEP. So some of these questions are in there. I wouldn't say the answers are all like spot on or like, like fully helpful yet, but this is worth taking a scan through and then Yeah, I know. So Lauren, Jeremy and Hillary join our T meeting or we did like a little one-off training with 'em last week and there was like so much more we didn't even get to, but I know the IMS got a little bit more clarity there. So feel free to collab on that topic as well in the near term. Okay, cool. \nZach Egan:\nAnd yeah, we're gonna do a, a train with a team's gonna lead a training and we'll have the updated like customer facing docs in, in early Jan is the plan. So that'll be something we'll need to align on and figure out because I think everyone thinks about it a little bit differently. All right. Pipeline a little bit lighter one today. 'cause we're only focused on two ones. There's a lot in here that is like three ones and four ones. We're only gonna focus on two ones. So let's start with the only one in due diligence. Rezi with tiro. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah. So this one is the one that Caitlyn and I have been working for a while now. He went to Amsterdam to meet with the co-founders and was like, Hey, we're not making decisions fast enough, but we are still excited about that. So we're checking in with him this week feeling decent about it. This is a group who's not offering benefits today. So it's just a question of like, are they willing to pull the trigger for two one or are they gonna continue to drag their feet? They came to us because they wanna offer benefits to retain and attract talent. Like that is their goal. So strategically that hasn't changed. It's just a matter of whether or not they wanna fork up, you know, money for this right now or if it ends up happening later in the year. Yeah. Okay. \nZach Egan:\nAnd I think given two one's like important more so for us than for them, I, I think we'd be more, you could proactively be like, hey, like, and, and you could even do like the classic sales type conversation where it's like, you know, hey, our end of year is two one and we're, we're incentivized as sellers to bring on as much business as possible. So with that being said, like we're willing to, you know, discount X percent if you're willing to move now versus midyear. \nRetsy Holliday:\nAnd we could make that, like We've already, we've already matched their vent pepm, so we're at a $20 PEPM right now with them. \nZach Egan:\nAnd no, no broker. No broker. Yeah. I mean, go Lower. I if if we, if we need to, I think if we, we would be willing, if we do, we'd be willing to go as low as we possibly can. Okay. To make this a two one versus a three one. Okay. For sure. Cool. \nRetsy Holliday:\nSo I will talk to Michael this week. Cool. \nZach Egan:\nAll right. And then next Sy KMC wraps Auto home life are, and there's two ones. Yep. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYep. KMC is a split off of La-Z-Boy, it's all of the non La-Z-Boy branded furniture. They're starting their own business. And so Caitlyn and I have done the cost analysis with the founders. They're great guys. They're super interested in that and very lovely to chat with. I will say our quote, like we did every variation dynamic, Mac, Mac flat cost, and we are still coming in like 200, $300,000 more than what they were expecting to spend. But they're also getting the same quotes from group. And so it sounds like we're, we're in the, definitely in the running, but we have not, I I don't know. We presented the quote on like Thursday of last week. So we told them to go play around with it. They are, they are gonna do carve out. So they have hourly part-time and then they have incentive based sellers. So we've done different quotes for each group and we're working through the process with them of evaluating each quote. So we shall see. \nZach Egan:\nAnd and The, the renewal is two one, They're not, they don't need a, sorry. \nRetsy Holliday:\nThey're creating like a new business and so Oh, I see. \nZach Egan:\nThe business. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, they're like an there is no renewal. They're ver technically a virgin group, but they are coming from from La-Z-Boy. Okay. \nZach Egan:\nAnd and in comparison to the like La-Z-Boy census or numbers were 200 K more expensive. \nRetsy Holliday:\nWe're actually more like three to 400 K. Okay. But they said that that is what they've been getting quoted in the group space. So they said that they had one quote that was much lower than us, but the quality of benefits was much worse. So I'm gonna be real, the numbers don't look great for them and honestly the employee experience is not great either. Like when we did our disruption employee net, like our actual analysis doing a silver one or a silver 25 for some of these groups was not, employees were not in a great spot. And so we explained that to them and they get to decide whether or not they wanna increase their budget or if they're okay with that. But they did say they are using benefits as a way to retain the talent that they are taking away from La-Z-Boy. Gotcha. \nZach Egan:\nOkay. And they're on their own internal payroll system? \nRetsy Holliday:\nYes, they have their own in-house. All right. \nZach Egan:\nYeah, We won't, we won't get our hopes up, but we'll keep it close. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, I'm gonna check in with them this week. They're really genuine and kind and like I know that they'll be real with us and whether or not this is realistic. Yeah. \nZach Egan:\nOkay, next one on here is wraps. \nRetsy Holliday:\nSo met with them. This is the, there's 85 Medicare eligible employees. This is the one I called you about Zach. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, we pushed them to a two one because obviously they called us last week and wanted to do a one one and we said no. And they're very interested and very intrigued. The numbers for group, the average of this group is like 59 years old. It's, yeah, it's an interesting cohort of employees. They, but that being said, the quote is actually very competitive. They're super interested, they are concerned about the Medicare experience. I'm gonna be very transparent. They're like, wait, what are they gonna have to do? How are these employees going to go through that workflow? But I am pinging, I back channeled the Paychex rep and told her that realistically we would like a decision by the end of week this week, early next week if we want a successful two one with this group. Yeah. \nZach Egan:\nSo, and okay. And then knowing what we know about Medicare or like kind of know at this point I, I want to talk to Jeremy and just be like, what other questions do we need to ask? Because like if we're gonna support the 85, I just, I mean we can foresee it now. Like we'll get them in there and then they'll be like, some question will come our way of like, Hey, are they all, you know, do they already go through social security process or whatever it is. So yeah, we'll just get, I'll make a note just to like get ahead of the Medicare piece and like actually work for that team to formalize a plan. Cool. \nRetsy Holliday:\nIf it, it makes everybody feel a little bit better. He did, the owner did say he thinks about 10 of the 85 would actually enroll and he is like the rest of them would, would unlikely enroll. So you know that obviously that 10 is a digestible number, 85 is not. And so I am, I'm not as concerned after our second call when he said he thinks only 10 would actually enroll. Okay. \nZach Egan:\nPerfect. That's super nice. All right. Anything we can do to support there? Otherwise your last one on here? Yeah. \nRetsy Holliday:\nHome life or Yes, there it is. Yeah. Home life USI referral how to lovely call with the decision makers. Last week she was emailing me over the weekend asking me for like how do I see SBCs and asking for the quote again on a different monitor. So they're definitely playing around with it. They're very intrigued. The U-S-I-U-S-I team feels like this is their only option. The home lifes team only option that would make sense for them next year. And I am, I've sent a note to the USI brokers today a asking for whether or not they think it's realistic for us to have a decision by end of week as well. So feeling decent about that one. Probably out of the three that is the, the highest likelihood here of moving forward. Okay. \nZach Egan:\nSweet. Anything the CPM team can do on the USI front? It sounds like they're like fully bought in and They're great. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, we have a great relationship with Casey and, and Chris and they're definitely advocating for us. They're actually side barring us and asking questions about thatch as well. So they're super engaged and we're, we're feeling like a, a good co-selling team right now. Cool. \nZach Egan:\nKara? Kay. Do we, I know we sent out, is Kara still here? Maybe not, maybe Doing something. \nJulia Korzeniowski:\nOkay. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nAll good on Mute, but she might be here. Okay. \nZach Egan:\nIf you're there or Julia, you might be able to help. I know we sent like a lot of gifts to brokers. I don't think it was current clients. Was just brokers recently, like we had the gift box. Is that like, can we do those as one-offs or was that like a mass shipment through Allie and her team that we weren't involved in? \nJulia Korzeniowski:\nWe did a, a mass send, but I do know that your team, we can, we, we can do and we can send, we can Chad, we can send one-offs and he created a channel this week. Yeah. And Chad is in it clearly asking if there were any one-offs. She also said she had a few extra gifts laying around. \nZach Egan:\nSo Shall we rip one to this USI crew team if we have it? That's great. \nChad Schneider:\nOkay. \nZach Egan:\nTo do that. There's a workflow it sounds like Jules and Chad. Yeah. \nChad Schneider:\nRusty, just send me the, the Info for the guy. I'll get it in there. Cool. \nZach Egan:\nPerfect. \nRetsy Holliday:\nThanks Chad. Got it. \nChad Schneider:\nNice. \nZach Egan:\nAll right. And then Tom, this is the midyear one. Mine's midyear. We're looking light on two ones, which means we cleaned it up, which is good. Dennis, oh, LFC meeting last week was, was good. What, what, what do next steps look like here? \nDenis Kalamar:\nI have a meeting with them for the middle of January to kind of evaluate it with their broker. They're not in a huge rush for a two one, but I do think that for a three one this could be a potential as well. Okay. \nZach Egan:\nSo we're meeting in mid-January is the next call. Yeah. So let's, I'm just gonna move it out just given like if we meet, even if we get like the verbal on January 15th, like we would've already needed to start enrollment for two one, right, exactly. \nDenis Kalamar:\nAnd so that's why, yeah, that's, I like a lot of these like larger ones where it's either self-funded groups, it's just not realistic to try and get a commitment at the beginning and especially 'cause they have I think 25 Medicare, Medicare eligible employees in New York. Yeah. \nZach Egan:\nOkay. We'll, we'll table it for now then. Any, that kind of sums up the two ones. So we just have a handful in flight. Anything else from the team that's relevant for a two ones? We're looking tight on pipeline folks. All right. Well I think it's expected. Like there's, this happened last year too. I can probably count on one hand like how many two ones were actually in play for mid-market. So with that being said, like this LFC one, Dennis, anything that's a three one or early next year, like that's just where our energy is gonna need to pivot. Like it's very unlikely we can pull these up unless we can somehow incentivize if we're moving our pep down to, you know, 10 by not for LC specifically Dennis, I mean like any other ones around that three, one timeframe, four ones where it's like, hey, if you lock in now we can get you like a $10 pep on things like that. Very open and willing to do that. But like obviously this is a interesting space where we not like traditional software where you can make that move anytime you want. So yeah, we'll keep doing what we can for these couple of two ones. That'll be the focus then everything else we're on to early next year. Any questions, comments, concerns from the squad, The Providence network? \nDenis Kalamar:\nIs that going to be updated within the new quoting tool? Corey said potentially by the end of the month, do we have like a, a little bit more of a solid timeline for that? \nZach Egan:\nI do not know. I can check with, you're asking if the new, the quoting tool will have those updates? Yeah. Honestly it shouldn't, but let me, lemme make a note to pin Cory about that. Okay. \nDenis Kalamar:\nI have a couple opportunities specifically like in the Tahoe, El Dorado and Nevada area that the Providence network expansion would make a huge difference And therefore for next year I take it. Yeah, well one of them if square two one, I just don't think realistically it makes sense with them until we get like those numbers to even when kind of formulate even proposing a two one transition. But I do think maybe a midyear, this is for Edgewood, Edgewood companies. Okay. \nZach Egan:\nI think if, let's, let's act like it's live. I'll get more intel to make sure like we'll be available by two one, but even if it doesn't like populate in the tool, if we're still hinting out like, hey, by the time they enroll they're also gonna have Providence. That could be enough. But let me get more clarification from Corey before we go too deep there. \nDenis Kalamar:\nAlright, Sounds good. All right. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nAnything else team Does, does anyone have deals for like 4, 1, 5, 1, maybe just four one that are like tracking well that we could book in January? \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, I got one. I'm pushing hard on LJ Rogers and offering 2025 pricing to try to get that done even though I'm kind of, you know, not sure what 2026 pricing looks like, but I'm offering 2025 pricing. But it's good. It's 210, 110 enrolled or 108 enrolled. It's a trucking company based out of North Carolina. So we, Caitlin and I spent an hour with them. We've done the initial pitch and then Caitlin and I spent an hour with them last week to do their like full employee disruption analysis. So it went really well. They were excited. No, I, I made that up Dennis. It fails. So they were very excited about the employee disruption analysis and then Danielle called me yesterday and said that she's doing another meeting with them on it and this week or early next week. So I'm pushing hard to get them to sign. I said, you just need to sign the contract by two one and get preferred pricing. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nNice. Love. Yeah, I mean even though fiscal, you know, fiscal ends two one just for the team, like any bookings, you know before two one is obviously things that will improve our, our fiscal year. So hopefully we get some, get some more of these in the coming coming weeks as well. \nRetsy Holliday:\nTom, that was one question for me was like, we book it, we get the contract signed by two one, but then enrollment's four one, do those enrolled lives count for 2025 enrolled lives or for 2026? \nTom Hemmingsen:\n2026. But in terms of like, you know, our, our business, especially next year as we continue to move up market like bookings are gonna become more and more important, right? Like Q1 of next year. We're obviously want to get a lot of enrollments based off whatever our numbers are, but the more bookings we can le level on top of that is, is beneficial too. So, so yeah, it's always like top, actually enrolled is best. That's real revenue. But you know, we've, we've shown that also like when people sign contracts with us, like for the most part our hit rate is very strong on those. So, but yeah, it'd be, it'd be just like something we could tell, you know, investors and the board and stuff. Cool. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nI guess a question, it's a little random if we have spare time, Go for it. So for some deals or like land and expand, we considered how the AEs will be involved. Like Rey and I just got off of this deal that had one person in New Mexico, so there's coming to us for a carve out. But it would be beneficial for her to remain involved since she already has all of the context. And right now the way our team is structured is that CS should be owning that, but really it's a little outside of their scope. 'cause as far as I know, and feel free to correct me if this is changing, there is no real incentive for upsells. So are we considering that as we're going forward and growing as a business? \nTom Hemmingsen:\nSort of like what the structure, so Yes, absolutely. \nZach Egan:\nAnd we've like hinted the idea of like an potential like account management team that owns renewals and upsells and that's like their sole purpose, which has been like how I've seen it in traditional SaaS in the past. It is still very up in the air. I, I think right now the goal is to get sales reps out of the sales cycle so they can focus on the next new business. But in this case, like I had a group called in beta that wanted to do a Texas carve out with like five people, but they were 250. And it's like, as a sales rep, I selfishly also want to be involved in that. So I think as those come up now and with no structure in place, let's just take 'em as one-offs. Like honestly, like rests. If, if you want to be involved post-sale on that one, like I would just say let's partner with, you know, Julia and Karen, the CS team to make sure we're all like lockstep on this. Or like if you come to periodic check-ins to help out how you can. Awesome. But cool. We also, we just gotta get on the same page with the, the teams, but for now, current state, I'm, I'm all for it if it's gonna lead to expansion. Thanks. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nThat makes sense. And I wouldn't be surprised if that's the way some, the larger groups also approach at grudge is knowing that it's a change For sure. \nZach Egan:\nI think, yeah, we'll see what future that looks like too. And like the enterprise space, like, you know, if you're holding onto just a handful of accounts and focusing on upsells, like there's right, right now, like the main way that we upsell is increased enrollment, right? And there's also like potential changes in the future with the marketplace. But yeah, it, it's a very, it's in the adolescent stages of any kind of plan. So we'll just do it as a one-off for now. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nThank you. \nZach Egan:\nAll right, squad, anything else? See you out there. Thank you. Thanks guys. \n",

The team reviewed enrollment performance for 12/15 groups and discussed pipeline opportunities.\n\nKey Discussion Points\n\nEnrollment Performance (12/15 Groups)\n- Strong Performance: Mid-market groups exceeded expectations with over 300K in ARR booked from enrolled members on 12/15 alone\n- Enrollment Rate: Almost all mid-market groups hit or exceeded 80% of expected enrollment\n- Notable successes:\n  - MetaSource: Increased from 60 to 260 enrolled\n  - NPA: Close to 1,200 enrolled (from ~600)\n  - LenStoler: 177 enrolled vs. 140 expected (127% of target)\n  - Elco: Over 100% of expected enrollment\n\nCritical Business Challenge: Medicare Workflow Gaps\nMajor Issue Identified: Current Medicare enrollment process is insufficient for the Medicare-eligible population\n- Root Causes:\n  1. Tech literacy barriers - many Medicare-eligible employees struggle with computers/online forms\n  2. Lack of phone support option (population prefers phone calls)\n  3. Advisor availability timing issues\n  4. Insufficient upfront education during sales cycle about Medicare requirements\n  5. Confusion about Parts A, B, D enrollment responsibilities\n\nImpact: Multiple groups experiencing friction:\n- LenStoler: 95-year-old owner and 68-year-old son need Medicare support\n- Elco: On-site experience revealed employees unable to navigate digital workflow\n- Wraps: 85 Medicare-eligible employees raising concerns\n\nProposed Solutions:\n- Phone number for Medicare population (top priority for 2026, in development)\n- One-pager document for sales cycle education (target: early January 2026)\n- Better sales cycle communication about Medicare requirements\n- Training for sales team on Medicare support scope\n\nStakeholder Identification\n\nInternal Team (Thatch)\n- Zach Egan: Sales team lead, facilitating pipeline review\n- Retsy Holliday: AE managing multiple opportunities (LenStoler, Tiro, KMC, Wraps, Home Life, LJ Rogers)\n- Kaitlin Zidar: Working with Retsy on deals\n- Denis Kalamar: AE managing 3G, LFC, Edgewood Companies\n- Tom Hemmingsen: Mid-year deal owner\n- Andrew Solomon: Operations/data support\n- Kara Kubarych: CS team lead, enrollment tracking\n- Julia Korzeniowski: Marketing/operations support\n- Chad Schneider: Gift/broker relations coordination\n- Jeremy: Medicare team lead\n- Gary: Leadership (mentioned re: two-ones completion)\n\nExternal Stakeholders (Prospects/Brokers)\n- Andy (LenStoler broker): High-anxiety, old-school broker requiring significant handholding\n- Casey & Chris (USI brokers): Strong advocates for Home Life deal\n- Paychex rep: Working on Wraps opportunity\n- Danielle: Involved in LJ Rogers deal progression\n\nImportant Milestones & Timestamps\n\nCompleted Milestones\n- 12/15/2025: Original enrollment deadline for mid-market cohort\n- 12/16/2025 (Meeting Date): Pipeline review conducted\n- Week of 12/9/2025: Multiple cost analyses and presentations delivered\n\nCritical Upcoming Dates\n- 12/19/2025: Extended enrollment deadline for 12/15 groups\n- End of Week (12/20/2025): Target decision date for:\n  - Wraps (85 Medicare-eligible employees)\n  - Home Life (USI referral, 110 enrolled potential)\n- Mid-January 2026: LFC meeting scheduled to evaluate options\n- Early January 2026: Medicare education materials and team training planned\n- 2/1/2026: Target start date for active pipeline opportunities\n\nActive Pipeline Opportunities (2/1/2026 Target)\n\n1.

Retsy: Follow-up calls with Tiro, KMC, Wraps decision-makers\n2. Retsy: Confirm Home Life decision timeline with USI brokers\n3. Chad: Send gift to USI broker team (Casey & Chris)\n4.

Pricing Strategy: Willing to discount to $10 PEPM for 2/1 commitments\n3. Bookings Focus: Any contracts signed before 2/1 improve fiscal year, even if enrollment is later\n4. Account Management: Consider AE involvement in land-and-expand scenarios (e.g., carve-outs)\n\nKey Business Insights\n\nPricing Flexibility\n- Team authorized to go as low as necessary on PEPM for 2/1 deals\n- 2025 pricing being offered for 4/1 deals if contracts signed by 2/1\n\nProcess Improvements Needed\n1. Medicare Education: Must happen earlier in sales cycle\n2. Expected Enrollment Field: Critical metric for CS team tracking\n3. Phone Support: Top priority for 2026 product roadmap\n4. Broker Gifts: Workflow established through Ally's channel\n\nMarket Dynamics\n- Strong Q4 enrollment performance demonstrates product-market fit\n- Medicare population support remains significant competitive differentiator and operational challenge\n- Land-and-expand opportunities emerging (carve-outs, state expansions)\n\nRisk Factors\n1. Medicare Workflow: Current process creating friction with brokers and clients\n2. Tight 2/1 Pipeline: Limited opportunities for February starts\n3. Budget Constraints: Some prospects (KMC) facing sticker shock vs. expectations\n4. Network Limitations: Providence expansion timing affecting Tahoe-area deals"

            "transcript": "Zach Egan:\nOh dude. \nAndrew Solomon:\nOh dude. Just ing a bunch of ais. \nZach Egan:\nI don't understand. Usually that happens when there's like an external email on the invite. Yeah, right. \nAndrew Solomon:\nLike mine doesn't add on these internal ones anymore. \nZach Egan:\nYeah, we have someone crushing the party. \nAndrew Solomon:\nOh, Snuck in Donny. \nDonny Ho:\nOh duck dude. \nZach Egan:\nYou got some lights in that room or no? \nAndrew Solomon:\nNo. \nDonny Ho:\nThat's a sick day today, so Oh, oh no, not, not trying to overstimulate myself. \nZach Egan:\nOh damn. Dude, I hopefully you can take it easy. Yeah. \nAndrew Solomon:\nZach, you wanna, you think, I think I know what it is on this invite And Julia's aol.com email is on it. So I think it's recognizing it as there's an external somebody on the call. \nZach Egan:\nI see. I mean, I know. I think the most surprising thing is Julia has an A OL account. Exactly. \nAndrew Solomon:\nIt's a rare Old school. \nZach Egan:\nDo you know what up? Nothing much. \nDenis Kalamar:\nI have a construction outside the door today, so I don't know how long that's gonna go for. \nZach Egan:\nSan Francisco. Where'd you get that hat? This one? \nDenis Kalamar:\nYeah, It's, it was in the box they sent us couple, couple months ago. Cool. \nZach Egan:\nMust have been nice. \nAndrew Solomon:\nYeah, It was. It was for new hire Zach. It was just a couple months late, so I don't think you made the cut. \nZach Egan:\nI see, I see. I missed out on a lot of swags Extras. \nPatricia Gorla:\nNo, this is, the extras are in the meeting room actually right below Inspire optimism meeting room right below the tv. \nZach Egan:\nSnag one In San Francisco, isn't it? That's a different one he's got though. That's like a relaxed fit. Oh, there's more. \nAndrew Solomon:\nSend the bar one. Zach. \nZach Egan:\nI, I'm in office so I could figure it out pretty quick. I'll give it a peek. All right, team. Happy Tuesday. I didn't realize there was a product offsite in office. So it's myself and the whole product team somewhere over here. But I wasn't allowed to have the breakfast tacos that were in the kitchen today. I wasn't, it was product only. So you're Y No, they, well I'm not, but then, but then Adlib was like, all right Zach, go ahead. So I guess you can, I, I felt I felt guilty but I did eat like three of 'em so That's probably why they knew that was coming. Yeah, like this guy can do some damage. All right. Squad little pipeline review action. First and foremost is everyone updated their two ones Hers the request last week? 'cause two ones feeling squeaky clean. If not, it's okay. But speak up or forever hold your peace because we need these. I got a thing from Gary this morning that we need these done. Everyone's good. It's all good. Rey. Yeah. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOkay, cool. \nZach Egan:\nCool. Kara, how are you doing? \nKara Kubarych:\nGood. I'm like just starting to pick my head up and think about what's in the pipeline for next year. So yeah, it's exciting also. Huge kudos everyone. I feel like we landed in a really good spot as of last night on all the 1215 mid-market groups, so, so yeah. Good stuff. \nZach Egan:\nWell and ku, kudos to your team Kara, because I think last night we had like over 300 and K, 300 K in a RR from like booked members just from last night, which is unreal. But if y'all haven't seen it, like if you check in on your ops and, and kind of how they progressed. Like I had, MetaSource had 60 enrolled last week. They ended at two 60, like super impressive. N PA was at like 600 for a while. They ended or are close to 1200 at this point. So the push has been huge. \nKara Kubarych:\nYeah, and we've had one other quick note there Zach. We've had very few at this point and we're gonna look through all the data today, tomorrow that has underperformed the expected enroll significantly, like using 80% as a threshold. Almost all of the mid markets have been at or above in some cases far above, which is pretty stellar. And of course there are lots of factors that drive that. So, so that I think, you know, that's really exciting. There are still a few that we wanna keep pushing through the end of this week. So 1219 is the deadline extension. I think everybody knows that almost everybody got extended. We don't expect there will be like a ton of movement though. And yeah, I was just gonna say I think there was a lot of last minute changes or like improvements which is also just like power of procrastination, which is pretty wild. But yeah, if people have like questions or anything you wanna flag to me about groups, you know, that you are at all concerned about, please, please do. But again, I think the communication has been really good and appreciate y'all working really closely with implementation managers through this process. \nZach Egan:\nYeah and thank, thank you Kara, maybe we start there. Is there any Kara that you're seeing that we are like tracking well behind on that we should talk about at the top of the call? \nKara Kubarych:\nYeah, let me just look at the latest list here real quick. Oh, what I was gonna say, I was like, I know I lost my train of thought on something. Of course the slack distracted me. We didn't have that expected enrolled number for a few, you know, not that many in all's cohort and, and thank you for kind of queuing it and updating it a few weeks ago. I know Zach helped organize that. We've pinged here and there where they, where they've been missing because there's, it's like not a calculated field, right? So you actually have to add it in Salesforce. So I know a bunch of those have been backfilled so thank you. But that metric has probably been the most powerful and I know like Chris and and team have had Bob definitely eyes on that of like the expected enroll enrolled versus expected enrolled. So please, please keep filling that out moving forward. It's really helpful. And then if you do have any that are blank but at this point I think on this team we're really good. You know, just continue to add that in 'cause it's been a great stat and we'll build like more scalable reporting around it here I can share my screen super fast just so people can see this list and then I'll let y'all move on. Lemme just filter to the relevant groups real quick. \nZach Egan:\nAnd while you do that, Kara, I just crossed the, the spreadsheet in chat. This team has been awesome. I think there's only a handful that are still outstanding. Rey, it looks like you have about 50, but they're all just the separated EINs from the 30 plus EN groups. So we exactly, Don't worry, Don't worry about that one. \nKara Kubarych:\nEL code Did really well by the way. I think over a hundred, Over a hundred enrolled Over a hundred percent expected. Oh yes. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOkay. I was like, that's not what I saw this morning. But that that, there we go. Yes. I was like, oh my god, I'm excited. Yeah, Zach, I did. Just so you know, I don't know if Andrew's on this call, but I asked Andrew about that one or just about like, could we somehow update the expected based on the enrollment list that we received from the, and he was like, I'm gonna try to do that at like a, I'm not manually gonna go into all our emails. \nZach Egan:\nNo, No, No. \nRetsy Holliday:\nAnd like track that, but Andrew did say he thought he could do this at like a higher level. So we might get a better, we might get better detail there. Yeah, yeah, no worries. \nZach Egan:\nAnd I, I pinged this morning as well. I think worst case scenario we'll just look at the the aggregate number. Yeah, for assumed and just, you know, I don't know it's, it is if we need to dive into each EIN if we do this as a whole. So, okay. \nKara Kubarych:\nI think yeah, no, no action On that. Zach, really quick. I don't, I think this is up to date. This is what he put together and I can ping y'all's way as an aggregate. I think this is correct. So this has overall enrollment rate and then it has the all the EINs. I think those are the four. Is there anyone else that's a, a multi EIN and this team's cohort that we're missing? \nZach Egan:\nNo, those are my two I'll go into That's, yeah, not that I know of. Cool. \nKara Kubarych:\nSo yeah, let me share this 'cause this is actually like a great little thing. He spun up. Go ahead. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYeah, just I just see it right there. The belonging medical group. Better Life Partners. That's one of mine that has two EINs. Yeah. \nKara Kubarych:\nOkay, so, so yeah, this I think is probably better. Like it was just too hard to merge into that sheet. But keep going Zach. \nZach Egan:\nYeah, that's good. Yeah, if we're good here we can just like rets I can use this or Andrew can use this to update that. You don't need to worry about it. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOkay, thank you. \nZach Egan:\nAnd then the only other ones that I saw in here, Sully, you had a handful. If you can pop into the doc that I put in chat, it's Rose 17 through 19 And then, and expect enrollment was not like a required field. It's basically the purpose is if we think it's gonna vary from the assumed enrollment, like what they had last year. Like let's say they had a hundred enrolled last year, but then they like aggressively slashed their benefits. They're offering like silver one at 70%, we think there'll be a dip. It's, it's our best like crack at what we think it should be so that way the CS team can go in and be like, hey they're, they're tracking behind, but it's actually in line with what's expected based on Sully's conversations. Right. Maybe we shouldn't push super hard on this group. Things like that. Cool. \nAndrew Solomon:\nExactly. Yeah, I, I had a question on that 'cause I went back and I just double checked to make sure that they were in Salesforce and they weren't port, they were in Salesforce but they weren't porting over. So should you want me, should I just manually add 'em here? \nZach Egan:\nYeah, if you could. Was it the expected enrollment field that was filled out? I think there's like three different enrollment fields. \nAndrew Solomon:\nYeah, There's like assumed and then expected I, I'd made sure that they were all filled in so I don't know if they just weren't pulling over, but I'll go in here and and double check them and add 'em. \nZach Egan:\nOkay. I'm looking now and I'm not seeing it as, oh here, lemme grab the screen share real quick. \nKara Kubarych:\nYeah and then I think we're looking at something similar but I'll come back to my list. I was just filtering Andrew's latest 'cause he just dropped this in Like I'm looking right here. \nZach Egan:\nSully on the right expected enrollments. Yeah. \nAndrew Solomon:\nCalled out the one I didn't do I see. \nKara Kubarych:\nHey, it's helpful. \nAndrew Solomon:\nNo thank you. Seriously. \nZach Egan:\nI did for mine. I knocked mine out this morning. I had like a handful that were blank so no, it's not a required field so no worries. \nAndrew Solomon:\nI Gotcha. \nZach Egan:\nAlright team Kara, anything else you wanna chat over? \nKara Kubarych:\nNo, let me hear now that I've got this filter down to what I have been generally looking at, lemme just pull this up and then I'll, I'll let y'all keep running. I don't think there's anything that will be super surprising on here. Oh here. The other thing is, let's look at all the ones that are end date of 1215. You can see this interesting dance that we've all been doing. All right. So I think, I think this should be the right cohort, but yeah, looking in here. So like Rey, I guess we didn't have it for LenStoler. Does that sound right? \nRetsy Holliday:\nExpected enrollment We did, I put, I manually put this in too. It was supposed to be 140 and we're at 177. \nKara Kubarych:\nOkay, amazing. Well we're doing super great for whatever reason. And again some of this I think is just, is just systems wonkiness and then Zach Perfect game. Did you have that one? \nZach Egan:\nIt should be in there. Expected was like a one 30 and they just eclipsed that last night. Amazing. \nKara Kubarych:\nOkay. So minus those, the only one that's a little bit low, but when you add them up, Tom is is the, these two. So I think their total is at like 90 something percent and I know they were were tough. So that was huge. Arc ended in a really good spot. MetaSource was challenging and they came up significantly. 3G Dennis came up to 92, which was a big increase and they were really low there for a while. And then I think I just pulled out some of your, all of yours Rusty. I I can pull them back. I just was trying to hide those couple so I don't know now what's going on. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOh, all the FX and Elco. \nKara Kubarych:\nYeah. Yeah. So I think yours are all, maybe just to let you guys get back to your meeting, anything you wanna shout out or concerned about Red Sea? \nRetsy Holliday:\nNo, no, no, no. I I think they're both, they're they're both good. I know, I know Elco is in a good spot. I think FX is like one employee across every location. It's like gonna be hard to, we'll see where we shake out. They had 45 previously enrolled out of 400 and they thought that there was going to be an increase in enrollment on thatch. So I think I bumped it up by like 10 es from previous enrollment. But no, IIII don't think there's much more we can do there. Okay. \nKara Kubarych:\nAnd I realize there are a couple of 1220 twos in here. Okay. Well if for whatever reason people wanna try to add backfill these couple one more time in Salesforce, go for it. But otherwise, yeah, the numbers are really good and we'll, we'll do another push on a handful of these through end of week. So yeah, good stuff. Awesome. \nZach Egan:\nThanks Kara. And before we jump into it, Resy, I think we should start with LenStoler is a group just so everyone's on the same page with like the recent Medicare conversations as well. I'll, I'll let you give like the general overview of maybe like the, the speed bump we're facing and then we'll kind of game plan as a group on what we could potentially do to help them out even though it looks kind of tight. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, I mean the, from an enrollment perspective, they've blown it outta the water. We were one 40 previously enrolled. We're at 1 77 as of today, so that's great. They're, I made it very clear like six times to the broker that the owners could not lento himself, could not participate on the plan. Lento is 95 years old and then LenStoler's son I guess is like 68 years old. And so they're both going onto Medicare. So it has been pretty, this is a new broker for us and he, he is old school and wants like a lot of support and a lot of handholding and so we've had many calls about how he needs to go support these two guys get on Medicare plans. His as a very generous offer. Jeremy gave Shelly the Medicare agent to the son Barry so that he could get enrolled on Medicare. And now as of yesterday, the broker is telling me he just realized that the 95-year-old LenStoler is on the group plan and hasn't been set up to be on like get onto a Medicare plan yet. So it's just creating some, some stress. Andy is just a, a high anxiety kind of guy and so he brings a lot of that energy into everything that we do. So I gave him Jeremy's personal calendar link, Calendly link today to meet with Jeremy and talk to him. I mean in this situation, like I think the overall feedback that is relevant for this call is that our Medicare workflow right now is not sufficient. It's, it is not s and and we got to witness that on site for anybody who went on site. Like it was, you know, you're pushing the population who is the most tech challenged to go use tech. And you would think that like since, you know, scheduling a Calendly link isn't that hard, but for that population it is, opening a computer is overwhelming for some of those folks. And so we are working through this now. I think we've been called out rightfully so by the broker that the Medicare process we have today is not sufficient and does not actually support this population. So we are working through this but I think the s-corp owners and needing Medicare support from them is more of like, I I put this a little bit on the broker, like the broker needs to own this and, but we are doing our best to also support him because he is just a very, he's an anxious dude and he really is looking to us to guide him through this process 'cause it's his first icra. \nZach Egan:\nSo Did the, did the call get scheduled with Jeremy today? And I Haven't heard back yet. \nRetsy Holliday:\nI sent him the calender link, Calendly link and have not gotten a, a response yet. So it might just resolve itself. That's my hope is That, Is that Andy and I don't talk today, but That's not gonna happen. \nZach Egan:\nYeah, probably not. \nRetsy Holliday:\nNo, we're like around, we're averaging five times a day right now, so, so you know, it is what it is. But I think it's a good, it's a good call out. We have a gap in our business right now. Medicare is not, our Medicare, Medicare workflow is not sufficient for that population right now. \nZach Egan:\nYeah. And I think, Can I ask you a quick question? \nKara Kubarych:\nIs it Rezi and I'm, I totally hear you. Lots of issues with Medicare escalations, all sorts of things. Do you think it's largely around, around the product and people not knowing how to make an account and like go through the form and schedule with an advisor? Or is it the advisor availability or is it that we're giving like misinformation or lack of information on what is required for Medicare enrollment? Like do you have a sense of like what the biggest buckets are? \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, I mean I think that you nailed 'em. I think number one is actually number one is that like people who come, like we had somebody come in in person at Elco who has chosen to be on group and not on Medicare. And when we told her that was no longer an option, she was furious. She literally got very angry and walked out on us. And so I think like one, this is not a that thing, this is an ICRA thing. When you go onto an icra you have to, if you are Medicare eligible, you have to go on Medicare. And so I actually think it's probably something in the sales cycle that we all need to be doing a little bit more education and talking about more upfront, Hey guys, your Medicare eligible employees have to go onto that. It's not an option. Also what the, and we talk a lot about like allowances and what that means from an allowance perspective and turning QME on and off. But we don't talk about like this is what it's going to look like for those employees. Here's a full deck that like, and, and I think the CS team does have those assets that come in during implementation, but it needs to be more upfront. It needs to be shared earlier on in the sales cycle so that it isn't such a surprise. Especially if they have a large Medicare population. And then I really like, I I think at the end of the day the workflow itself Kara like when you go in and first yes creating an account, like we had one woman at Elco literally sit down and point to the computer and say, I don't, I don't know how to do that. And she's literally talking about opening a computer. Like it is very overwhelming for this population to have to, to find something in their email, click on that link, go create their account. And then from there the two options, the workflow options are enter this, go your information into this Google form. That's hard. Like I, I sat next to somebody and walked her through how to do that and she had her social security page with her right there in that moment and like had all the information she needed. She still didn't feel comfortable doing this by herself. And then I think when you bring, if you need to go shopping for a plan, the fact that like we were on site and then we were like, oh you're gonna meet with a Medicare agent in four days from now. They were like, no, I don't wanna meet with a Medicare agent in four days from now. I'm here now to get this done and I don't wanna wait. And so I think it's a combination of everything that you said Kara, but I, you know, those are like the, the bigger buckets that I would say are, are the pain points. The feedback that I have received from multiple brokers now is you need a phone number for the Medicare population. They know how to use a cell phone. They know how to call somebody. That is what they're comfortable doing. Push like multiple people at Elco told us we don't have laptops. So like we set up phone literally Megan is a fricking rockstar on product. She sat down and downloaded Google Meet on somebody's cell phone so that they could meet with the advisor in four days from when we met with them. But I don't think anything's gonna come from that. Like they're, they're not able to enter anything onto their phone. They're not, they're confused on how to do that. So I think a phone number is how you solve it for this population. Yeah. \nKara Kubarych:\nSuper resonant. \nZach Egan:\nYeah. And we are between this group, we are going to have a phone number next year and it is in the works. Amazing. We're not talking about it or like making promises now 'cause that timeline's very TPD but that's the top priority for Garrity and it's for this exact reason amongst many other reasons. Do I think it'll like solve all of these problems? No, but it'll give them someone who can perhaps direct them on how to do it. I think the most challenging thing that development I've seen as of late is like my personal understanding of how we support the Medicare front is just not correct. Like I, since I began spoke to our prospects saying, hey we help folks enroll in parts A and B, we do not, we can help with like part D and supplementals, but it is on the onus is on the individual. And I think the, the biggest pushback I've heard is like for for brokers, some of them are equipped to do this, some feel like it shouldn't be their job. But even for that individual to like, okay, now how do I go to the social security office? Like any guidance that we can provide would be helpful. So what we are working on, I met with the Medicare team, we're gonna have, they're working on a one pager right now that we're gonna send in every single sales cycle. If it's a, a post, you know, follow up email and it's like, hey you must read this or this is important at the, at the end of the day though it doesn't fix everything. We can say like, hey we can point back to a piece of paper that said we told you how it was gonna work. Right. So some of it isn't like a thatch problem as much as like, you know, the onus is on them as well to do some education. So we're gonna get better during the sales cycle. But that starts with us fully understanding how we support on that front, which is like honestly been a moving target over the past couple months. So I'll keep working with that team and, and we're gonna have something early January we can start shipping out there. \nRetsy Holliday:\nDennis, is that true? \nKara Kubarych:\nYeah, because it's, I think It's, yeah, go ahead. \nDenis Kalamar:\nYeah, so it's actually not like not illegal for 65 and above. You can actually still enroll into an A CA plan if you're 65 and older. It's just gonna be more, it's gonna be cheaper if you go to the Medicare route and it's gonna be better benefits. But this is something that Julia and I are seeing for 3G is because the Medicare rep actually kind of screwed up the timing and they're not gonna actually be enrolled into the Medicare plan until the end of January or further. And so in the meantime he actually enrolled into an ACA plan and he is like 67 and he is doing that for the seven Medicare folks. Oh interesting. \nRetsy Holliday:\nAs like a stop gap. So like they're actually going to like healthcare.gov signing up for a plan there. They'll reimburse that in the interim until the Medicare plan comes onto the platform and then they can switch it or the Is that Exactly, Yeah. Is do you need a qualifying life event to be able to switch from the ac like the on exchange plan to this Medicare plan Or No. \nDenis Kalamar:\nSo that's what we're trying to figure out right now. The hub Medicare person like actually enrolled it and he said it should be fine. But the issue is, is that if you're enrolled in an A CA plan, like you're in the Medicare enrollment process and then you sign up for an a CA plan that's not legally compliant. But if you don't start the enrollment process, then you can sign up for the a CA plan. Oh, interesting. But don't they need to get their applications in now in order to, It's only six months within the timeframe of when they're Medicare eligible six, six months previously and six months post. Okay. \nRetsy Holliday:\nHmm. \nDenis Kalamar:\nSo that's why like I think that just the guidance on kind of what we're saying as sales reps needs to align with kind of like Yeah because we've been getting called out a few times from Medicare, a Hundred percent Specific reps. Yeah, yeah, No doubt. \nRetsy Holliday:\nSo You're saying my 95-year-old is not gonna be able, this wouldn't work for my 95-year-old since he's been eligible for Medicare for 30 years. \nDenis Kalamar:\nHonestly, like I don't have full like confidence in anything Medicare. Okay. This is like, I'm just like going around the channel. It's like, but I do know 65 and above you can go to the A marketplace, you don't have to enroll into Medicare if you don't wanna. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOkay, alright, good to know. \nKara Kubarych:\nAlso, just share, this isn't, this doesn't answer all the questions and definitely a lot more to discuss, but this support page has been updated with some of the FAQs we've been getting during OEP. So some of these questions are in there. I wouldn't say the answers are all like spot on or like, like fully helpful yet, but this is worth taking a scan through and then Yeah, I know, so Lauren, Jeremy and Hillary joined our CST meeting or we did like a little one off training with 'em last week and there was like so much more we didn't even get to, but I know the IMS got a little bit more clarity there. So feel free to collab on that topic as well in the near term. Okay, cool. \nZach Egan:\nAnd yeah, we're gonna do a, a training with a team's gonna need a training and we'll have the updated like customer facing docs in, in early Jan is the plan. So definitely something we all need to align on and figure out because I think everyone thinks about it a little bit differently. All right. Pipeline a little bit lighter one today. 'cause we're only focused on two ones. There's a lot in here that is like three ones and four ones. We're only gonna focus on two ones. So let's start with the only one in due diligence. Rezi with Tiro. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah. So this one is the one that Caitlyn and I have been working for a while now. He went to Amsterdam to meet with the co-founders and was like, Hey, we're not making decisions fast enough, but we are still excited about that. So we're checking in with him this week feeling decent about it. Thi this is a group who's not offering benefits today. So it's just a question of like, are they willing to pull the trigger for two one or are they gonna continue to drag their feet? They came to us because they wanna offer benefits to retain and attract talent. Like that is their goal. So strategically that hasn't changed. It's just a matter of whether or not they wanna fork up, you know, money for this right now or if it ends up happening later in the year. Yeah. \nZach Egan:\nOkay. And I think given two ones like important more so for us than for them, I, I think we'd be more, you could proactively be like, hey, like, and, and you could even do like the classic sales type conversation where it's like, you know, hey, our end of year is Q1 and we're, we're incentivized as sellers to bring on as much business as possible. So with that being said, like we're willing to, you know, discount X percent if you're willing to move now versus midyear. \nRetsy Holliday:\nAnd we could make that like We've already, we've already matched their ventor pep so we're at a $20 PEPM right now with them. \nZach Egan:\nAnd no, no broker. No broker. Yeah. I mean go Over I if if we, if we need to. I think if we do, we would be, yeah, we'd be willing to go as low as we possibly can. Okay. To make this a two one versus a three one. Okay. \nRetsy Holliday:\nFor sure. \nZach Egan:\nCool. \nRetsy Holliday:\nSo I will talk to Michael this week. Cool. \nZach Egan:\nAll right. And then next Resy, KMC wraps Auto home life are, and there's two ones. Yep. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYep. KMC is a split off of La-Z-Boy, it's all of the non La-Z-Boy branded furniture. They're starting their own business. And so Caitlin and I have done the cost analysis with the founders. They're great guys. They're super interested in that and very lovely to chat with. I will say our quote, like we did every variation dynamic, Mac, Mac flat cost and we are still coming in like 200, $300,000 more than what they were expecting to spend. But they're also getting the same quotes from group. And so it sounds like we're, we're in the, definitely in the running, but we have not, I I don't know. We presented the quote on like Thursday of last week. So we told them to go play around with it. They are, they are gonna do carve out. So they have hourly part-time and then they have incentive based sellers. So we've done different quotes for each group and we're working through the process with them of evaluating each quote. So we Shall see and and their, their renewal is two one, They're not, they don't need a, sorry. They are creating like a new business and so I see the business. I see. Yeah, they're like an there is no renewal. They're ver technically a virgin group, but they are coming from from Lazboy. Okay. \nZach Egan:\nAnd and in comparison to the like Lazboy census or numbers were 200 K more expensive? \nRetsy Holliday:\nWe're actually more like three to 400 K. Okay. But they said that that is what they've been getting quoted in the group space. So they said that they had one quote that was much lower than us, but the quality of benefits was much worse. So I'm gonna be real, the numbers don't look great for them and honestly the employee experience is not great either. Like when we did our disruption employee net, like our actual analysis doing a silver one or a silver 25 for some of these groups was not employees were not in a great spot. And so we that to them and they get to decide whether or not they wanna increase their budget or if they're okay with that. But they did say they are using benefits as a way to retain the talent that they are taking away from La-Z-Boy. Gotcha. \nZach Egan:\nOkay. And they're on their own internal payroll system? \nRetsy Holliday:\nYes. They have their own in-house. \nZach Egan:\nYeah. We won't, we won't get our hopes up, but we'll keep it close. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, I'm gonna check in with them this week. They're really genuine and kind and like I know that they'll be real with us on whether or not this is realistic. Yeah. \nZach Egan:\nOkay, next one on here is wraps. \nRetsy Holliday:\nSo met with them. This is the, there's 85 Medicare eligible employees. This is the one I called you about Zach. Yeah. \nZach Egan:\nYeah. \nRetsy Holliday:\nSo yeah, we pushed them to a two one because obviously they called us last week and wanted to do a one one and we said no. And they're very interested and very intrigued. The numbers group, the average of this group is like 59 years old. It's, yeah, it's an interesting cohort of employees. They, but that being said, the quote is actually very competitive. They're super interested, they are concerned about the Medicare experience. I'm gonna be very transparent. They're like, wait, what are they gonna have to do? How are these employees going to go through that workflow? But I am pinging, I back channeled the Paychex rep and told her that realistically we would like a decision by the end of week this week, early next week if we want a successful two one with this group. Yeah. \nZach Egan:\nSo, and okay. And then knowing what we know about Medicare or like kind of know at this point I, I want to talk to Jeremy and just be like, what other questions do we need to ask? Yeah, because like if we're gonna support the 85, I just, I mean we can foresee it now. Like we'll get them in there and then they'll be like, some question will come our way of like, Hey, are they all, you know, do they already go through social security process or whatever it is. So yeah, we'll just get, I'll make a note just to like get ahead of the Medicare piece and like actually work for that team to formalize a plan. Cool. \nRetsy Holliday:\nIf it, it makes everybody feel a little bit better. He did, the owner did say he thinks about 10 of the 85 would actually enroll and he is like the rest of them would, would unlikely enroll. So you know that obviously that 10 is a digestible number, 85 is not. And so I am, I'm not as concerned after our second call when he said he thinks only 10 would actually enroll. Okay. \nZach Egan:\nPerfect. That's super nice. All right. Anything we can do to support there? Otherwise your last one on here? Yeah. \nRetsy Holliday:\nHome life or Yes, there it is. Yeah. Home life USI referral had a lovely call with the decision makers last week. She was emailing me over the weekend asking me for like how do I see PLA SBCs and asking for the quote again on a different monitor. So they're definitely playing around with it. They're very intrigued. The U-S-I-U-S-I team feels like this is their only option. The home lifes team only option that would make sense for them next year. And I am, I've sent a note to the USI brokers today asking for whether or not they think it's realistic for us to have a decision by end of week as well. So feeling decent about that one probably outta the three that is the, the highest likelihood here of moving forward. Okay. \nZach Egan:\nSweet. Anything the CPM team can do on the US side front? It sounds like they're like fully bought in in terms Of that. \nRetsy Holliday:\nThey're great. Yeah, we have a great relationship with Casey and, and Chris and they're definitely advocating for us. They're actually side baring us and asking questions about thatch as well. So they're super engaged and we're, we're feeling like a, a good co-selling team right now. Cool. \nZach Egan:\nKara? Kay Do we, I know we sent out, is Kara still here? Maybe not. \nJulia Korzeniowski:\nMaybe Doing something. Okay. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nAll good Then on mute. But she might be here. Okay. \nZach Egan:\nIf you're there or Julia, you might be able to help. I know we sent like a lot of gifts to brokers. I don't think it was current clients, it was just brokers recently. Like we had the gift box. Is that like, can we do those as one-offs or was that like a mass shipment through Ally and her team that we weren't involved in? \nJulia Korzeniowski:\nWe did a, a mass send, but I do know that your team, we can, we, we can do and we can send one, we can Chad, we can send one off and Ally created a channel this week. Yeah. And Chad is in it clearly asking if there were any one-offs. She also said she had a few extra gifts laying around. \nZach Egan:\nSo Shall we rip one to this USI crew team if we have it? That'd great. \nChad Schneider:\nOkay. \nZach Egan:\nTo do that. There's a workflow it sounds like Jules and Chad. \nChad Schneider:\nYeah, rusty, just send me the, the info for the guy. I'll Get it in there. Cool. \nZach Egan:\nPerfect. \nRetsy Holliday:\nThanks Chad. \nChad Schneider:\nYou got it. Nice. \nZach Egan:\nAll right and then Tom, this is the mid-year one. Mine's mid-year. We're looking light on two ones, which means we cleaned it up, which is good. Dennis, oh LFC meeting last week was, was good. What, what, what do next steps look like here? \nDenis Kalamar:\nI have a meeting with them for the middle of January to kind of evaluate it with their broker. They're not in a huge rush for two one, but I do think that for a three one this could be potential as well. Okay. \nZach Egan:\nSo we're meeting in mid-January the next call. So let's, I'm just gonna move it out just given like if we meet, even if we get like the verbal on January 15th click, we would've already need to start enrollment for a two one, right? Exactly. \nDenis Kalamar:\nAnd so that's fine. That's, I like a lot of these like larger ones where it's either self-funded groups, it's just not realistic to try and get a commitment at the beginning and especially 'cause they have I think 25 Medicare, Medicare eligible employees in New York. Yeah. \nZach Egan:\nOkay. Well, we'll table it for now then. Any, that kind of sums up the two ones. So we just have a handful in flight. Anything else from the team that's relevant for a two one? We're looking tight on pipeline folks. All right. Well I think it's expected, like there's, this happened last year too. I can probably count on one hand like how many two ones were actually in play for mid-market. So with that being said, like this LFC one, Dennis, anything that's a three one or early next year, like that's just where our energy is gonna need to pivot. Like it's very unlikely we can pull these up unless we can somehow incentivize if we're moving our pum down to, you know, 10 by not for LC specifically Dennis, I mean like any other ones around that three, one timeframe, four ones where it's like, hey, if you lock in now we can get you like a $10 pum. Things like that. Very open and willing to do that. But like obviously this is a interesting space where we not like traditional software where you can make that move anytime you want. So yeah, we'll keep doing what we can for these couple of two ones. That'll be the focus and everything else we're on to early next year. Any questions, comments, concerns from the squad, The Providence network? \nDenis Kalamar:\nIs that going to be updated within the new quoting tool? Corey said potentially by the end of the month, do we have like a, a little bit more of a solid timeline for that? \nZach Egan:\nI do not know. I can check with, you're asking if the new, the quoting tool will have those updates? Yeah. Honestly it should. But let me, lemme make a note to ping Cory about that. Okay. \nDenis Kalamar:\nI have a couple opportunities specifically like in the Tahoe, El Dorado and Nevada area that the Providence network expansion would make a huge difference. \nZach Egan:\nAnd the for for next year I take it. \nDenis Kalamar:\nYeah, well one of them if were two one, I just don't think realistically it makes sense with them until we get like those numbers to even kind of formulate even proposing a two one transition. But I do think maybe a midyear, this is for Edgewood, Edgewood companies. Okay. \nZach Egan:\nI think if, let's, let's act like it's live. I'll get more intel to make sure like we'll be available by two one, but even if it doesn't like populate in the tool, if we're still hinting out like, hey, by the time they enroll they're also gonna have Providence. That could be enough. But let me get more clarification from Corey before we go too deep there. \nDenis Kalamar:\nOkay, sounds good. All right. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nAnything else team Does, does anyone have deals for like 4, 1, 5, 1, maybe just four one that are like tracking well that we could book in January? \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, I got one. I'm pushing hard on LJ Rogers and offering 2025 pricing to try to get that done even though I'm kind of, you know, not sure what 2026 pricing looks like, but I'm offering 2025 pricing. But it's good. It's 210, 110 enrolled or 108 enrolled. It's a trucking company based out of North Carolina. So we, Caitlyn and I spent an hour with them, we've done the initial pitch and then Caitlyn and I spent an hour with them last week to do their like full employee disruption analysis. So it went really well. They were excited. No, I, I made that up Dennis. It fails. So they were very excited about the employee disruption analysis and then Danielle called me yesterday and said that she's doing another meeting with them on it and this week or early next week. So I'm pushing hard to get them to sign. I said you just need to sign the contract by two one and get preferred pricing Around. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nNice. Love it. Yeah, I mean even though fiscal, you know, fiscal ends two one just for the team, like any bookings you know before two one is obviously things that will improve our, our fiscal year. So hopefully we get some, get some more of these in the coming coming weeks as well. \nRetsy Holliday:\nTom, that was one question for me was like we book it, we get the contract signed by two one, but then enrollments four one, do those enroll lives count for 2025 enrolled lives or for 2026? \nTom Hemmingsen:\n2026. But in terms of like, you know, our, our business, especially next year as we continue to move up market like bookings are gonna become more and more important. Right. Okay. So like Q1 of next year, we're obviously want to get a lot of enrollments based off whatever our numbers are, but the more bookings we can le level on top of that is, is beneficial too. So, so yeah, it's always like top actually enrolled is best. That's real revenue. Yeah. But you know, we've, we've shown that also like when people sign contracts with us, like for the most part our hit rate is very strong on those. So, but yeah, it'd be, it'd be just like something we could tell, you know, investors and the board and stuff. Cool. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nAsk a question. It's a little random if we have spare time, Go for it. So Chris, some deals are like land and expand. Have we considered how the AEs will be involved? Like Rey and I just got off of this deal that had one person in New Mexico, so they're coming to us for a carve out. But it would be beneficial for her to remain involved since she already has all of the context. And right now the way our team is structured is that CS should be owning that, but really it's a little outside of their scope. 'cause as far as I know, and feel free to correct me if this is changing, there is no real incentive for upsells. So are we considering that as we're going forward and growing as a business? \nTom Hemmingsen:\nSort of like what the structure, so Yes, absolutely. \nZach Egan:\nAnd we've like hinted the idea of like in potential like account management team that owns renewals and upsells and that's like their sole purpose, which has been like how I've seen it in traditional SaaS in the past. It is still very up in the air. I, I think right now the goal is to get sales reps out of the sales cycle so they can focus on the next new business. But in this case, like I had a group called in beta that wanted to do a Texas carve out with like five people, but they were 250. And it's like, as a sales rep, I selfishly also want to be involved in that. So I think as those come up now and with no structure in place, let's just take 'em as one-offs. Like honestly, like rests. If, if you want to be involved post-sale on that one, like I would just say let's partner with, you know, Julia and Karen, the CS team to make sure we're all like lockstep on this. Or like if you come to periodic check-ins to help out how you can. Awesome. But cool. We also, we just gotta get on the same page with the, the teams. But for now current state, I'm, I'm all for it if it's gonna lead to expansion. Thanks. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nThat makes sense. And I wouldn't be surprised if that's the way some, the larger groups also approach at grudge is knowing that it's a change For sure. \nZach Egan:\nI think, yeah, we'll see what future that looks like too. And like the enterprise space, like, you know, if you're holding onto just a handful of accounts and focusing on upsells, like there's right, right now, like the main way that we upsell is increase enrollment, right? And there's also like potential changes in the future with the marketplace. But yeah, it, it's a very, it's in the adolescent stages of any kind of plan. So we'll just do it as a one-off now. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nThank you. \nZach Egan:\nAlright squad, anything else? See you out there. Thank you. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nThanks Guys. \n",

Pricing Competitiveness\n   - Some quotes $200-300K above client expectations\n   - Competing with group plan pricing\n\nOPTIMIZATION GOALS:\n\n1. Immediate (Q1 2026):\n   - Phone number for Medicare population (top priority)\n   - One-pager for Medicare process in sales cycle\n   - Better sales education on Medicare support scope\n   - Updated support documentation (already in progress)\n\n2. Future Considerations:\n   - Account management team for renewals/upsells\n   - Providence network expansion integration into quoting tool\n   - Scalable Medicare enrollment reporting\n\nKEY METRICS:\n- Strong 12/15 mid-market enrollment performance: 300K+ ARR booked in one night\n- Most groups at or above 80% expected enrollment threshold\n- Deadline extended to 2025-12-19 for final enrollments"

Usually, that happens when there's an external email on the invite. \nAndrew Solomon:\nYeah, right? Mine doesn't add on these internal ones anymore. \nZach Egan:\nYeah, we have someone crashing the party. \nAndrew Solomon:\nDonnie? \nZach Egan:\nYou got some lights in that room, or no? \nDonny Ho:\nNo, not trying to over stimulate myself. \nZach Egan:\nDamn dude, hopefully you can take it easy. Yeah, Zach, you want, you think? \nAndrew Solomon:\nI think I know what it is. Uh, on this invite and Julia's Aol.com email is on it. So I think it's recognizing it as there's an external somebody on the call. \nZach Egan:\nI see, I mean, I don't know. I think the most surprising thing is Julia has an AOL account. Exactly. It's a rare. \nAndrew Solomon:\nOld school. \nZach Egan:\nDo you know what else? \nDenis Kalamar:\nNothing much. I have a construction outside the door today, so I don't know how long that's going to go for. \nZach Egan:\nSan Francisco. Where'd you get that hat? \nDenis Kalamar:\nThis one? Yeah, it's, uh, it was in the box they sent us a couple, a couple months ago. Cool. \nZach Egan:\nMust have been nice. \nAndrew Solomon:\nIt was, it was for new hire, Zach. It was just a couple months late, so I don't think you made the cut. \nZach Egan:\nI see, I see. I missed out on a lot of swag. Extras. \nPatricia Gorla:\nNo, this is, the extras are in the meeting room, actually right below. Inspire Optimism meeting room right below the TV snag. \nZach Egan:\nOne in San Francisco, isn't it? That's a different one he's got, though. It's like a relaxed fit. \nAndrew Solomon:\nThere's more. Send them our way. \nZach Egan:\nZach I'm in office so I could figure it out pretty quick. I'll give it a peek. All right, team, Happy Tuesday. I didn't realize there's a product off-site in office, so it's myself and, uh, the whole product team somewhere over here. But I wasn't allowed to have the breakfast tacos that were in the kitchen today, I wasn't, it was product only. \nAndrew Solomon:\nSo you're kidding? \nZach Egan:\nNo, they, well, I'm not, but then. But then Adler was like, All right, Jack, go ahead, so I guess you can, I. I felt I felt guilty, but I did eat like three of them, so that's probably why they knew that was coming. Yeah, like this guy can do some damage. Uh, all right, squad. A little pipeline review action. Um, first and foremost, has everyone updated their two ones? Hers the request last week is two ones. Feeling squeaky, clean? If not, it's okay, but speak up or forever hold your peace. Because we need these. I got a ping from Gary this morning that we need these done. Everyone's good. Sully, good. Red. C. Yeah. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOkay. \nZach Egan:\nCool, cool. Kara, how are you doing? \nKara Kubarych:\nI'm good. I'm like, just starting to pick my head up and think about what's in the pipeline for next year. So that's exciting. Also. Huge kudos, everyone. I feel like we landed in a really good spot as of last night on all the 1215 mid-market groups. So, yeah, good stuff. \nZach Egan:\nWell, and kudos to your team, Kara, because I think last night we had like over 300k in ARR from like booked members just from last night, which is unreal. But if you all haven't seen it, like if you check in on your ops and... Kind of how they progressed, like I had Metasource had 60 enrolled last week, they ended at 260. Like, super impressive. Napalm was at like 600 for a while, they ended, or are close to 1200 at this point. Um, so the push has been huge. \nKara Kubarych:\nYeah, and we've had one other quick note there, exactly, we've had very few at this point. We're going to look through all the data today, tomorrow. Um, that has underperformed the expected enrolled significantly, like using 80 as a threshold. Almost all of the mid markets have been at or above, in some cases far above, which is pretty stellar. Um, and of course, there are lots of factors that drive that, um, so so that I think, you know, that's really exciting. There are still a few that we want to keep pushing through the end of this week. So 12 19 is the deadline extension. I think everybody knows that almost everybody got extended. We don't expect there will be like a ton of movement, though. Um, and Yeah, I was just going to say, I think there was a lot of last minute changes or like improvements, which is also just like power of procrastination, which is pretty wild. But yeah, people have like questions or anything you want to flag to me about groups that you are at all concerned about. Please, please do. But again, I think the communication has been really good and appreciate y'all working really closely with implementation managers through this process. Yeah. \nZach Egan:\nThank you, Carol. Maybe we start there. Is there any care that you're seeing that we are, like, tracking well behind on that we should talk about at the top of the call? \nKara Kubarych:\nYeah, let me just look at the latest list here real quick. Oh, what I was going to say, I was like, I know I lost my train of thought on something. Of course, the slack distracted me. We didn't have that expected enrolled number for a few, you know, not that many in your all's cohort. And thank you for kind of queuing it and updating it a few. Weeks ago, I know Zach helped organize that. Um, we've pinged here and there where they, where they've been missing. Because it's like, not a calculated field, right? So you actually have to add it in salesforce. So I know a bunch of those have been backfilled, so thank you. Um, but that metric has probably been the most powerful, and I know, like Chris and Team have had it. Bob definitely eyes on that of, like, the expected enroll enrolled versus expected enrolled. So please, please keep filling that out moving forward. It's really helpful. And then if you do have any that are blank, But at this point, I think on this team, we're really good. You know, just continue to add that in because it's been a great stat and we'll build like more scalable reporting around it here. I can share my screen super fast just so people can see this list and then I'll let y'all move on. We just filter to the relevant groups real quick. \nZach Egan:\nAnd while you do that, Kara, I just dropped the spreadsheet in chat. This team has been... Awesome. I think there's only a handful that are still outstanding. Retsi, it looks like you have about 50, but they're all just the separated Eins from the 30 plus Ein group. So we don't worry about that one. \nKara Kubarych:\nElko did really well, by the way, I think over 100. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOver 100 enrolled? \nKara Kubarych:\nOver 100% expected. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOh, yes. Okay. I was like, that's not what I saw this morning, but that, that, there we go. Yes. I was like, Oh my God, I'm excited. Yeah, Zach, I did just so, you know, I don't know if Andrew's on this call, but I asked Andrew. About that one, um, or just about like, could we, um, somehow update the expected based on the enrollment list that we received from the UM? And he was like, I'm gonna try to do that at like, a, I'm not manually gonna go into all. \nZach Egan:\nNo, no, no, like track that. \nRetsy Holliday:\nBut Andrew did say he thought he could do this at like a higher level. So we might get a better, we might get better detail there. \nZach Egan:\nYeah, yeah, no worries. And I I pinged him this morning as well. I think, worst case scenario, we'll just look at the aggregate number, uh, for assumed, and just, you know, I don't know if it's, it's if. We need to dive into each EIN and please do this as a whole. \nRetsy Holliday:\nSo, okay, I think no. \nKara Kubarych:\nNo action on that doc really quick. Um, I don't know. I think this is up to date. This is what he put together and I can ping your all's way. As an aggregate, I think this is correct, so this has overall enrollment rate and then it has the all the EINs. I think those are the four. Is there anyone else that's a multi Ein in this team's cohort that we're missing? \nRetsy Holliday:\nNo, those are my two. \nZach Egan:\nThat's, yeah, not that I know of. Cool. \nKara Kubarych:\nSo, yeah, let me share this, because this is actually like a great little thing, he spun up. Go ahead. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYeah, just I just see it right there. The belonging medical group that are like. Partners That's one of mine that has two eins. Yeah, okay, sweet. \nKara Kubarych:\nSo yeah, this, I think, is probably better. Like it was just too hard to merge into that sheet, but keep going. \nZach Egan:\nZACH Yeah, that's good. Yeah, if we're good here, we can. Just like rets. I can use this for Andrew, can use this to update that you don't need to worry about it. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOkay, thank you. \nZach Egan:\nAnd then the only other ones I saw in here, Uh, Sully, you had a handful, uh. If you can pop into the doc that I put in chat, it's rows 17 through 19. And then an expected enrollment was not like a required field. It's basically, uh, the purpose is, if we think it's going to vary from the assumed enrollment. Like what they had last year, like, let's say they had 100 enrolled last year, but then they like, aggressively slashed their benefits. They're offering like silver one at 70 we think will be a dip. It's it's our best, like crack at what we think it should be. So that way the CS team can go in and be like they're tracking behind. But it's actually in line with what's expected, based on Sully's conversations, right? Maybe we shouldn't push super hard in this group, things like that, that's cool, exactly. \nAndrew Solomon:\nYeah, I had a question on that. Because I went back. And I just double checked to make sure that they were in salesforce and they weren't. They were in salesforce, but they weren't porting over. So should you want me to show this manually, Adam here? \nZach Egan:\nYeah, if you could, was it the expected enrollment field that was filled out? I think there's like three different enrollment fields. \nAndrew Solomon:\nYeah, there's like, assumed and then expected. I'd made sure that they were all filled in. Um, so I don't know if they just weren't pulling over, but I'll go in here and double check them and add them. \nZach Egan:\nOkay, I'm looking now and I'm not seeing it as, Oh, here, let me grab the screen share real quick. \nKara Kubarych:\nYeah, and then I think we're looking at something similar, but I'll come back to my list. I was just filtering Andrew's latest because he just dropped this in, like, Uh, I'm looking right here, slowly on the right. \nZach Egan:\nExpected enrollments. \nAndrew Solomon:\nYeah, I might have called out the one I didn't do. I see. \nKara Kubarych:\nHey, it's helpful. \nZach Egan:\nNo, thank you. \nAndrew Solomon:\nSeriously. \nZach Egan:\nI did for mine. I knocked mine out this morning. I had like a handful that were blank. So, no, it's not a required field. So no worries. \nAndrew Solomon:\nI gotcha. All right, team. \nZach Egan:\nKara, anything else you want to chat over? \nKara Kubarych:\nNo, let me hear. Now that I've got this filter down to what I... Have been generally looking at, let me just pull this up and then I'll keep running. I don't think there's anything that will be super surprising on here. Oh, here. The other thing is, let's look at all the ones that are end date of 1215. You can see this interesting dance that we've all been doing. All right. So I think, I think this should be the right cohort. But yeah, looking in here. So, like Red Sea, I guess we didn't have it for Lund Stoller. Does that sound, right? \nRetsy Holliday:\nExpected enrollment? We did. I manually put this in, too. It was supposed to be 140 and we're at 177. \nKara Kubarych:\nOkay, amazing. Well, we're doing super great for whatever reason. And again, some of this, I think, is just systems wonkiness. And then Zach, perfect game. Did you have that one? \nZach Egan:\nIt should be in there. Expected was like a 130, and it just eclipsed that last night. Amazing. \nKara Kubarych:\nOkay. So minus those, the only one that's a little bit low, but when you add them up, Tom, is these two. So I think their total is at like 90 something percent. And I know they were tough. So that was huge. Arc ended in a really good spot. Metasource was challenging, and they came up significantly. 3G, Dennis came up to 92, which was a big increase, and they were really low there for a while. And then I think I just pulled out some of. Um, your all of yours, Retzi. I can pull them back. I just was trying to hide those couple. Um, uh, so I don't know now what's going on. All the sphinx and Elko, Yeah, yeah, I think yours are all. Maybe just to let you guys get back to your meeting. Anything you want to shout out or concerned about? Retzi? \nRetsy Holliday:\nNo, no, no, no. I think they're both good. I know Elko's in a good spot. I think Sphinx is like one employee across every location. It's like going to be hard to, we'll see where we shake out. They had 45 previously enrolled out of 400, and they thought that there was going to be an increase in enrollment on thatch. So I think I bumped it up by like 10 e's from previous enrollment. But no, I don't think there's much more we can do there. Okay. \nKara Kubarych:\nAnd I realize there are a couple of 1222s in here. Okay. Well, if, for whatever reason, people want to try to add backfill these couple one more time in Salesforce, go for it. But otherwise, yeah, the numbers are really good and we'll do another push on a handful of these through end of week. So yeah, good stuff. Awesome. \nZach Egan:\nThanks, Kara. And before we jump into it, Retsi, I think we should start with Len Stoller's group, just so everyone's on the same page with the recent Medicare conversations as well. I'll let you give, like the general overview of maybe like the speed bump we're facing. And then we'll kind of game plan as a group on what we could potentially do to help them out. Even though it looks kind of tight. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, I mean the from an enrollment perspective, they've blown it out of the water. We were 140 previously enrolled, we're at 177 as of today, so that's great. There, um, I made it very clear, like six times, to the broker, that the owners could not. Len Stoller himself could not participate on the plan. Um, Len Stoller is 95 years old, and then Len Stoller's son, I guess, is like 68 years old. Um, and so they are both going on to Medicare, so it has been pretty, um, this is a new broker for us. And he, uh, he is um old school and wants like, a lot of support and a lot, lot of handholding. And so we've had many calls about how he needs to go support these two guys get on Medicare plans. His as a very generous offer, Jeremy gave Shelly, the Medicare agent, to the son, Barry, so that he could get enrolled on Medicare. And now, as of yesterday, the broker is telling me he just realized that. The 95 year old Len Stoller is on the group plan and hasn't been set up to be like, get onto a Medicare plan yet. So it's just creating. Some, some stress. Um, Andy is just a high anxiety kind of guy and so he brings a lot of that energy into everything that we do. Um, so I gave him Jeremy's personal calendar like Calendly Link today to meet with Jeremy and talk to him. Um, I mean, in this situation like, I think the overall feedback that is relevant for this call is that our Medicare, uh, workflow right now is not sufficient. It's it is not, and we got to witness that on site, for anybody who went on site like it was. You know, you're pushing the population who is the most tech challenged to go use tech. And you would think that, like, you know, scheduling a calendly link isn't that hard, but for that population it is. Um, opening a computer is overwhelming for some of those folks. And so, um, we are working through this now, I think we've been called out rightfully. So by the broker that the Medicare process we have today is not sufficient and does not actually support this population, so we are working through this. But I think the S-Corp owners and needing Medicare support from them is more of like, I put this a little bit on the broker. Like, the broker needs to own this. And but we are doing our best to also support him because he is just a very, he's an anxious dude. And he really is looking to us to guide him through this process because it's his first ICRA. \nZach Egan:\nSo did the call get scheduled with Jeremy today? \nRetsy Holliday:\nAnd I haven't heard back yet. I sent him the calendar link, Calendly link and have not gotten a response yet. So it might just resolve itself. That's my hope. Is that Andy and I don't talk today? That's not going to happen. Yeah, probably not. No, we're like, around, we're averaging five times a day right now. So, you know, it is what it is. But I think it's a good, it's a good call out. We have a gap in our business right now. Medicare is not, our Medicare workflow is not sufficient for that population right now. \nZach Egan:\nYeah. And I think. \nKara Kubarych:\nCan I ask you a quick question? Is it, Retsi, and I totally hear you, lots of issues with Medicare, escalations, all sorts of things. Do you think it's largely around the product and people not knowing how to make an account and, like, go through the form and schedule with an advisor? Or is it the advisor availability? Or is it that we're giving like misinformation or lack of information on what is required for Medicare enrollment? Like, do you have a sense of, like, what the biggest buckets are? \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, I mean, I think that you nailed them. I think number one is actually number one is that like people who come like, we had somebody come in, in person at Elko, who has chosen to be on group and not on Medicare. And when we told her, that was no longer an option. She was furious. She literally got very angry and walked out on us. And so I think, like one, this is not a thatch thing. This is an icra thing. When you go onto an ICRA, you have to, if you are Medicare eligible, you have to go on Medicare. And so I actually think it's probably something in the sales cycle that we all need to be doing a little bit more education and talking about more upfront. Hey guys, your Medicare eligible employees have to go onto thatch. It's not an option. Also what the, and we talk a about, like allowances, and what that means from an allowance perspective, and turning QME on and off. But we don't talk about, like, this is what it's going to look like for those employees. Here is a full deck. That like, and I think the CS team does have those assets that come in during implementation, but it needs to be more upfront. It needs to be shared earlier on in the sales cycle so that it isn't such a surprise, especially if they have a large Medicare population. And then I really like, I think at the end of the day, the workflow itself, Kara, like when you go in and first, yes, creating an account, Like, we had one woman at Elko literally sit down and point to the computer and say, I don't know how to do that. And she's literally talking about opening a computer. Like, it is very overwhelming for this population to have to find something in their email, click on that link, go create their account. And then from there, the two options, the workflow options are. Enter your information into this Google form. That's hard. Like, I sat next to somebody and walked her through how to do that. And she had her Social Security page with her right there in that moment and, like, had all the information she needed. She still didn't feel comfortable doing this by herself. And then I think, when you bring, if you need to go shopping for a plan, The fact that, like, we were on site and then we were like, oh, you're going to meet with a Medicare agent in four days from now. They were like, no, I don't want to meet with a Medicare agent in four days from now. I'm here now to get this done. And I don't want to wait. And so I think it's a combination of everything that you said, Kara. But I, you know, those are like the bigger buckets that, I would say, are the pain points. The feedback that I have received from multiple brokers now is you need a phone number for the Medicare population. They know how to use a cell phone. They know how to call somebody. That is what they are comfortable doing. Push like multiple people at Elko told us, we don't have laptops. So like, we set up phone. Literally, Megan is a freaking rock star on product. She sat down and downloaded. Google meet on somebody's cell phone so that they could meet with the advisor in four days from when we met with them. But I don't think anything's going to come from that. Like, they're, they're not able to enter anything onto their phone. They're not, they're confused on how to do that. So I think a phone number is how you solve it for this population. \nZach Egan:\nYeah. Yeah. And we are between this group. We are going to have a phone number next year and it is in the works. We're not. Talking about it, or like, making promises now, because that timeline is very TBD. But that's the top priority for Gary. And it's for this exact reason, amongst many other reasons. Do I think it'll, like, solve all of these problems? no, but it'll give them someone who can perhaps direct them on how to do it. Um, I think the most challenging thing. That development I've seen as of late is like, my personal understanding of how we support in the Medicare front was just not correct. Like I, since that began, spoke to our prospects, saying, Hey, we help folks enroll in parts A and B. We do not. We can help with, like part D and supplementals, but it is on the onus, is on the individual. And I think that the biggest pushback I've heard is like, for brokers, some of them are equipped to do this. Some feel like it shouldn't be their job. But even for that individual to like, okay, now how do I go to the Social Security office? Like, any guidance that we can provide would be helpful. So what we are working on. I met with the Medicare team. We're going to have, they're working on a one pager right now that we're going to send in every single sales cycle. Uh, if it's a post, you know, follow-up email and it's like, Hey, you must read this, this is important. And then, at the end of the day, those doesn't fix everything. We can say, like, Hey, we can point back to a piece of paper that said, we told you how it was going to work, right? So some of it isn't like a thatch problem as much as like, you know, the onus is on them as well to do some education. So we're going to get better during the sales cycle, But that starts with us fully understanding how we support on that front, which is, like, honestly, been a moving target over the past couple months. So I'll keep working with that team and we're going to have something early January. We can start shipping out there. \nRetsy Holliday:\nAnd is that true? \nDenis Kalamar:\nYeah, because. \nKara Kubarych:\nYeah. \nDenis Kalamar:\nYeah. So it's actually not you like, not illegal for 65 and above. You can actually still enroll into an ACA plan if you're 65 and older. It's just going to be more, it's going to be cheaper if you go to the Medicare route, and it's going to be better benefits. But this is something that Julia and I are seeing for 3G is because the Medicare rep actually kind of screwed up the timing. And they're not going to actually be enrolled into the Medicare plan until the end of January or further. And so in the meantime, he actually enrolled into an ACA plan, and he's like 67, and he's doing that for the seven Medicare folks. Oh, interesting. \nRetsy Holliday:\nAs like a stopgap. So, like, they're actually going to like healthcare.gov. Signing up for a plan there? They'll reimburse that in the interim until the Medicare plan comes out of the platform and then they can switch it. Or is that, yeah? Do you need a qualifying life event to be able to switch from the AC, like the on exchange plan to this Medicare Plan or no? \nDenis Kalamar:\nThat's what we're trying to figure out right now. The Hub Medicare person, like, actually enrolled it and he said it should be fine. But. But the issue is is that if you're enrolled in an ACA plan, like, you're in the Medicare enrollment process and then you sign up for an ACA plan. That's not legally compliant. But if you don't start the enrollment process, then you can sign up for the ACA plan. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOh, interesting. But don't they need to get their applications in now in order to? \nDenis Kalamar:\nIt's only six months within the time frame of when they're Medicare eligible. So, six months previously and six months post. Okay. So that's why, like. I think that just the guidance on kind of what we're saying as sales reps needs to align with, kind of. like, because we've been getting called out a few times from Medicare reps. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, no doubt. So you're saying my 95 year old is not going to be able, this wouldn't work for my 95 year old. Since he's been eligible for Medicare for 30 years. \nDenis Kalamar:\nHonestly, like, I don't have full confidence in anything. Medicare. This is like, I'm just like going around the channel. It's like, but I do know. 65 and above, you can go to the ACA marketplace. You don't have to enroll into Medicare if you don't want to. \nRetsy Holliday:\nAll right. Good to know. \nKara Kubarych:\nBut also just share, this doesn't answer all the questions and definitely a lot more to discuss, But this support page has been updated with some of the FAQs we've been getting during OEP. So some of these questions are in there. I wouldn't say the answers are all spot on or fully helpful yet, but this is worth taking a scan through. And then, yeah, I know so. Lauren, Jeremy and Hillary joined our CST meeting. Or we did like a little one-off training with them last week, and there was like, so much more we didn't even get to. But um, I know that I am got a little bit more clarity there, so feel free to collab, um, on that topic as well in the near term. \nZach Egan:\nOkay, cool, um, and yeah. We're gonna do a train with that team,'s gonna lead a training. And we'll have the updated like customer facing docs in early Jan, is the plan. So that would be something we all need to align on and figure it out. Cause I think everyone thinks about it a little bit differently. Um, all right. Pipeline a little bit lighter one today. Cause we're only focused on two ones. Um, there's a lot in here that is like three ones and four ones. We're only going to focus on two ones. So let's start with the only one in due diligence, Red Sea with Tiro. \nRetsy Holliday:\nUm, yeah, so this one is the one that Caitlin and I've been working for a while now. He went to Amsterdam to meet with the co founders and was like, Hey, we're not making decisions fast enough, but we are still excited about that. So we're checking in with him this week, feeling decent about it. Um, this is a group who's not offering benefits today. So it's just a question of, like, are they willing to pull the trigger for two one? Or are they going to continue to drag their feet? They came to us because they want to offer benefits to retain and attract talent. Like, that is their goal. So, strategically, that hasn't changed. It's just a matter of whether or not they want to fork up money for this right now, or if it ends up happening later in the year. \nZach Egan:\nYeah. OK. And I think, given 2.1 is, like, important, more so for us than for them, I think you could proactively be like, hey, like. And you could even do like the classic sales type conversation where it's like, you know, hey, our end of year is 2.1. We're incentivized as sellers to bring on as much business as possible. So, with that being said, like, we're willing to, you know, discount x percent if you're willing to move now versus mid year. And we can make that like. \nRetsy Holliday:\nWe've already, we've already matched their venture, pep them. So we're at a $20 pep them right now with them. \nZach Egan:\nAnd no, no broker. \nRetsy Holliday:\nNo broker. \nZach Egan:\nYeah. I mean. \nRetsy Holliday:\nGo learn. \nZach Egan:\nI, if we, if we need to, I think we'd be willing to go as low as we possibly can to make this. A two one versus a three one, for sure. Cool. \nRetsy Holliday:\nSo I will talk to Michael this week. \nZach Egan:\nCool. Um, all right. And then, uh, next Resi KMC wraps auto home life are all. There's two ones. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYep, yep, KMC is a, uh, split off of lazy boy, it's all of the non-lazy boy branded furniture. Um, they're starting their own business, and so Caitlyn and I have done the cost analysis with the UM founders. They're great guys, they're super interested in that um, and very lovely to chat with. I will say our quote like we did every variation, dynamic MAC, MAC, flat cost. And we are still coming in like $200,000, $300,000 more than what they were expecting to spend. But they're also getting the same quotes from group. And so it sounds like we're definitely in the running. But we have not, I don't know. We presented the quote on like Thursday of last week. So we told them to go play around with it. They are going to do carve out. So they have hourly, part-time. And then they have incentive-based sellers. So we've done different quotes for each group, and we're working through the process with them of evaluating each quote. So we shall see. \nZach Egan:\nAnd the renewal is 2.1? \nRetsy Holliday:\nThey don't need a sorry, they are creating, like, a new business. \nZach Egan:\nAnd so the business. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, there is no renewal. They're technically a Virgin group, but they are coming from Lazy Boy. \nZach Egan:\nOkay. And in comparison to the, like, lazy boy, census, or numbers were 200k more expensive? \nRetsy Holliday:\nWe're actually more like 300 to 400k. But they said that that is what they've been getting quoted in the group space. So they said that they had one quote that was much lower than us, but the quality of benefits was much worse. So I'm going to be real. The numbers don't look great for them. And honestly, the employee experience is not great either. Like when we did our disruption employee net, like our actual analysis, doing a silver one or a silver 25 for some of these groups was not. Employees were not in a great spot and so we explained that to them. And they get to decide whether or not they want to increase their budget or if they're okay with that. Um, but they did say they are using benefits as a way to retain the talent that they are taking away from. \nZach Egan:\nLazy Boy Gotcha, Okay? And they're on their own internal payroll system. \nRetsy Holliday:\nUh, yes, they have their own in-house. \nZach Egan:\nYeah, we won't, we won't get our hopes up, but we'll keep it close. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, I'm going to check in with them this week. They're really genuine and kind. And, like, I know that they'll be real with us, and whether or not this is realistic. Yeah. \nZach Egan:\nOkay. Next one on here is wraps. \nRetsy Holliday:\nSo met with them. This is the, There's 85 Medicare eligible employees. This is the one I called you about, Zach. \nZach Egan:\nYeah, yeah. \nRetsy Holliday:\nSo yeah, we pushed them to a 2-1 because obviously they called us last week and wanted to do a 1-1 and we said no. And they're very interested and very intrigued. The numbers for a group, the average of this group is like 59 years old. It's, yeah, it's an interesting cohort of employees. They. But that being said, the quote is actually very competitive. They're super interested. They are concerned about the Medicare experience. I'm going to be very transparent. They're like, wait, what are they going to have to do? How are these employees going to go through that workflow? But I'm pinging, I back-channeled the Paychex rep. And told her that. realistically, we would like a decision by the end of this week, early next week, if we want a successful 2-1 with this group. Yeah. So. \nZach Egan:\nOkay. And then knowing what we know about Medicare, or, like, kind of know. At this point, I want to talk to Jeremy and just be like, what other questions do we need to ask? Because if we're going to support the 85, I just, I mean, we could. Foresee it now. Like, we'll get them in there and then they'll be like, some question will come our way of, like, Hey, are they all, you know? Do they already go through Social security process or whatever it is? So, yeah, um, we'll just get, uh, I'll make a note just to, like, get ahead of the Medicare piece and like, actually work for that team to formalize a plan. \nRetsy Holliday:\nCool if it, it makes everybody feel a little bit better, he did. The owner did say he thinks about 10 of the 85 would actually enroll, and he's like the rest of them would unlikely enroll. So, um, you know, that obviously that 10 is a digestible number. Eighty five is not. And so I'm. I'm not as concerned after our second call when he said he thinks only 10 would actually enroll. \nZach Egan:\nOK, perfect. That's super nice. All right. Anything we can do to support there? Otherwise, your last one on here. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah. Home life. \nZach Egan:\nYes, there it is. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah. Home Life, um, USI Referral had a lovely call with the decision makers last week. She was emailing me over the weekend asking me for like, how do I see SBCs? and, um, asking for the quote again on a different monitor. So they're definitely playing around with it. They're very intrigued. Um, the USI, USI team feels like this is their only option, the Home Life's team, only option that would make sense for them next year. And I am. I've sent a note to the USI brokers today asking for whether or not they think it's realistic for us to have a decision by end of week as well. So feeling decent about that one, probably out of the three, that is the highest likelihood here of moving forward. \nZach Egan:\nOkay, sweet. Anything the CPM team can do on the USI front sounds like they're like fully bought in. \nRetsy Holliday:\nThey're great. Yeah, we have a great relationship with Casey and Chris, and they're definitely advocating for us. They're actually sidebarring us and asking questions about Thatch as well. So they're super engaged. And we're we're feeling like a good co-selling team right now. \nZach Egan:\nCool. Kara Kay, do we I know we sent out? is Kara still here? Maybe not. \nJulia Korzeniowski:\nMaybe you're doing something. Okay. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nOn mute, but she might be here. Okay. \nZach Egan:\nIf you're there or Julia, you might be able to help. I know we sent like a lot of gifts to brokers. I don't think it was current clients. It was just brokers recently. Like, we had the gift box. Is that, like, can we do those as one officer? Was that like a mass shipment through Allie and her team that we weren't involved in? \nJulia Korzeniowski:\nWe did a mass send, but I do know that. Your we can do and we can send one, we can send one-offs. And he created a channel this week, and Chad is in it, clearly, um, asking if there were any one-offs. She also said she had a few extra gifts laying around. \nZach Egan:\nSo shall we rip one to this USI crew team? If we have it okay to do that? There's a workflow. It sounds like Jules and Chad? \nChad Schneider:\nYeah, Rusty, just send me the info for the guy. I'll get it in there. \nRetsy Holliday:\nPerfect. Thanks, Chad. You got it. \nChad Schneider:\nNice. \nZach Egan:\nAll right. And then, Tom, this is the mid-year one. Mine's mid-year. We're looking light on two ones, which means we cleaned it up, which is good. Dennis, oh, LFC. Meeting last week was... Was good. What was what the next steps look like? Here? \nDenis Kalamar:\nI have a meeting with them for the middle of January to kind of evaluate it with their broker. They're not in a huge rush for a 2-1, but I do think that for a 3-1 this could be potential as well. \nZach Egan:\nOkay, so we're meeting in mid-January is the next call. Yeah, so let's, I'm just gonna move it out. Just given. Like if we meet, even if we get like the verbal on January 15th. Like we would have already need to start enrollment for a 2-1, right? Exactly. \nDenis Kalamar:\nAnd so that's, that's like a lot of these, like larger ones, where it's either self funded groups, It's just not realistic to try and get a commitment at the beginning, and especially because they have, I think, 25 Medicare, Medicare eligible employees in New York. \nZach Egan:\nYeah, okay, well, we'll table it for now then. Any, that kind of sums up the two ones. So we just have a handful in flight. Anything else from the team? That's relevant for a 2-1. We're looking tight on pipeline, folks. All right, well, I think it's expected. Like, there's, this happened last year, too. I can probably count, on one hand, like, how many 2-1s were actually in play for mid-market. So, with that being said, like this LFC1, Dennis, anything that's a 3-1 or early next year. Like, that's just where our energy is going to need to pivot. Like, it's very unlikely we can pull these up unless we can somehow incentivize if we're moving our pep them down to, you know, 10, But not for LLC specifically, Dennis. I mean, like any other ones around that three, one timeframe, four ones where it's like, hey, if you lock in now, we can get you like a $10 pep them, things like that. Very open and willing to do that. But like, obviously this is an interesting space where we not like traditional software, where you can make that move anytime you want. So. Um, yeah, we'll keep doing what we can for these couple of two ones, that'll be the focus and everything else we're on to early next year. Any questions, comments, concerns from the squad? \nDenis Kalamar:\nThe Providence Network? Is that going to be updated within the new quoting tool, Cory said, potentially by the end of the month. Do we have a little bit more of a solid timeline for that? \nZach Egan:\nI do not know. I can check with... You're asking if the quoting tool will have those updates. Yeah. \nDenis Kalamar:\nHonestly, it should. \nZach Egan:\nBut let me make a note to pin Corey about that. \nDenis Kalamar:\nOkay. I have a couple opportunities, specifically in the Tahoe, El Dorado, and Nevada area, that the Providence network expansion would make a huge... \nZach Egan:\nUm, and they're for for next year. I take it. \nDenis Kalamar:\nYeah, well, one of them have scored two, one. I just don't think realistically it makes sense with them. Until we get like those numbers to even kind of formulate, even proposing a two one, uh transition. But I do think maybe a mid-year. This is for Edgewood, um, Edgewood companies. \nZach Egan:\nOkay, I think, if let's, let's act like it's live, uh, I'll get more intel to make sure like we'll be available by 2.1, But even if it doesn't like populate in the tool, if we're still hinting out, like, hey, by the time they enroll, they're also going to have providence, that could be enough. But let me get more clarification from Corey before we go too deep there. \nDenis Kalamar:\nAll right. Sounds good. All right. \nZach Egan:\nAnything else, team? \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYes. Does anyone have deals for like 4.1, 5.1? Maybe just for one that are like tracking well that we could book in January? \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, I got one. I'm pushing hard on L.J. Rogers and offering 2025 pricing to try to get that done, even though I'm kind of, you know, not sure what 2026 pricing looks like, but I'm offering 2025 pricing. But it's good. It's 210, 110 enrolled, or 108 enrolled. It's a trucking company based out of North Carolina. So we, Caitlin and I spent an hour with them. We've done the initial pitch and then Caitlin and I spent an hour with them last week to do their like full employee disruption analysis. So it went really well. They were excited. No, I made that up, Dennis. Fails. So they were very excited about the employee disruption analysis. And then Danielle called me yesterday and said that. She's doing another meeting with them on it and this week or early next week. So I'm pushing hard to get them to sign. I said, you just need to sign the contract by 2-1 and get preferred pricing. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYeah. I mean, even though fiscal, you know, fiscal ends. 2-1 just for the team, like any bookings, you know, before 2-1 is obviously things that will improve our fiscal year. So hopefully we get some more of these in the coming weeks as well. \nRetsy Holliday:\nTom, that was one question for me was like, we book it, we get the contract signed by 2-1, but then enrollments 4-1, Do those enrolled lives count for 2025 enrolled lives or for 2026? \nTom Hemmingsen:\n2026, But in terms of like, you know, our business, especially next year, as we continue to move up market, like bookings, are going to become more and more important, right? So like Q1. Of next year. We're obviously want to get a lot of enrollments based off whatever our numbers are, but the more bookings we can level on top of that is is beneficial too. So, um, so yeah, it's always like, top, actually enrolled is best, that's real revenue. But you know, we've. We've shown that also, like when people sign contracts with us, like, for the most part, our hit rate is very strong on those. So, um, but yeah, it'd be, it'd be just like something we could tell, you know, investors and the board and stuff. Cool. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nI asked a question. It's a little random. If we have spare time, go for it. So for some deals that are like Land and Expand, have we considered how the AES will be involved? Like, Brett C and I just got off of this deal that has one person in New Mexico. So they're coming to us for a carve out, But it would be beneficial for her to remain involved since she already has all of the context. And right now, the way our team is structured is that CS should be owning that, but really, it's a little outside of their scope. Cause, as far as I know, and feel free to correct me, this is changing. There is no real incentive for upsells. So are we considering that as we're going forward and growing as a business? \nZach Egan:\nSo. Yes, absolutely. And we've hinted the idea of a potential account management team that owns renewals and upsells, and that's their sole purpose, which has been how I've seen it in traditional Saas in the past. It is still very up in the air. I think right now the goal is to get sales reps out of the sales cycle so they can focus on the next new business. But in this case, I had a group called Embeda. I wanted to do a Texas carve out with like five people, but they were 250. And it's like, as a sales rep, I selfishly also want to be involved in that. So I think as those come up now and with no structure in place, let's just take them as one-offs. Like, honestly, like rats, if you want to be involved post-sale on that one, like, I would just say, let's partner with, you know, Julia and Karen, the CS team, to make sure we're all like, lockstep on this. Or, like, if you come to periodic check-ins to help out, how you can. Awesome. But. Well, we also, we just got to get on the same page with the teams. But for now, current state, I'm all for it. If it's going to lead to expansion. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nThanks. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nThat makes sense. And I wouldn't be surprised if that's the way some of the larger groups also approach it. Just knowing that it's a change. \nZach Egan:\nFor sure. I think, yeah, we'll see what future that looks like, too. And like the enterprise space, like, you know, if you're holding on to just a handful of accounts and focusing on upsells, like, there's. Right now, the main way that we upsell is increased enrollment. And there's also potential changes in the future with the marketplace. But yeah, it's in the adolescent stages of any kind of plan. So we'll just do it as a one-off for now. Thank you. All right, squad. Anything else? See you out there. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nThank you. \nRetsy Holliday:\nThanks, guys. \n",

Retsy Holliday:\n   - Follow up with Michael (Tiro) - offer additional discount if needed to secure 2-1\n   - Check in with KMC on quote evaluation\n   - Get decision from RAPS (coordinate with paychecks rep)\n   - Confirm decision timeline with USI brokers (Home Life)\n   - Push L.J.

Medicare Support Gaps: Systemic workflow issues could impact customer satisfaction and enrollment success\n2. Tight 2-1 Pipeline: Limited opportunities for February 1 start dates\n3. Pricing Pressure: KMC significantly over budget; may require further discounting\n4.

            "transcript": "Zach Egan:\nAll right. All right, dude. That's all, dude. That's all. \nAndrew Solomon:\nBunch of Ais. \nZach Egan:\nI don't understand. Usually that happens when there's like an external, uh, email on the invite. \nAndrew Solomon:\nYeah, right, like mine doesn't add on these internal ones anymore. \nZach Egan:\nYeah, we have someone crushing the party. \nAndrew Solomon:\nSnuck in. Donnie, Oh, dude, you had some lights in that room or no? \nDonny Ho:\nNo, that's a sick day today. So no, no, not not trying to overstimulate myself. \nZach Egan:\nDamn dude, hopefully you can take it easy. Yeah, Zach, you want, you think? \nAndrew Solomon:\nI think I know what it is. Uh, on this invite and Julia's Aol.com email is on it. So I think it's recognizing it as there's an external somebody on the call. \nZach Egan:\nI see, I mean, I don't know. I think the most surprising thing is Julia has an AOL account. Exactly. It's a rare. \nAndrew Solomon:\nOld school. \nZach Egan:\nDo you know what else? \nDenis Kalamar:\nNothing much. I have a construction outside the door today, so I don't know how long that's going to go for. \nZach Egan:\nSan Francisco. Where'd you get that hat? \nDenis Kalamar:\nThis one? Yeah, it was in the box they sent us a couple months ago. Cool. \nZach Egan:\nMust have been nice. \nAndrew Solomon:\nIt was for a new hire, Zach. It was just a couple months late, so I don't think you made the cut. \nZach Egan:\nI see, I see. I missed out on a lot of swag. Extras. \nPatricia Gorla:\nNo, this is the extras are in the meeting room, actually, right below. Inspire Optimism meeting room right below the TV snag. \nZach Egan:\nOne in San Francisco, isn't it? That's a different one he's got, though. It's like a relaxed fit. \nAndrew Solomon:\nOh, there's more. Send them our way. \nZach Egan:\nZach. I'm in office so I could figure it out pretty quick. I'll give it a peek. All right, team, Happy Tuesday. I didn't realize there's a product off-site in office, so it's myself and, uh, the whole product team somewhere over here. But I wasn't allowed to have the breakfast tacos that were in the kitchen today, I wasn't, it was product only. \nAndrew Solomon:\nSo, yeah, no, they, well, I'm not. \nZach Egan:\nBut then it was in. The Adler was like, All right, Jack, go ahead, so I guess you can, I. \nAndrew Solomon:\nI felt I felt guilty, but I did eat like three of them, so that's probably why they knew that was coming. \nZach Egan:\nYeah, this guy can do some damage. All right, squad. A little pipeline review action. First and foremost, has everyone updated their 2-1s? Her's the request last week. Is 2-1s feeling squeaky clean? If not, it's okay. But speak up or forever hold your peace, because we need these. I got a ping from Gary this morning that we need these done. Everyone's good telly, good red Sea. Yeah, okay, cool, cool, um, cara, how you doing good. \nKara Kubarych:\nI'm like, just starting to pick my head up and think about what's in the pipeline for next year. So yeah, that's exciting. Also, huge kudos, everyone. I feel like we landed in a really good spot as of last night on all the 1215 mid-market groups. So, yeah, good stuff. \nZach Egan:\nWell, and kudos to your team, Kara, because I think last night we had like over 300k in ARR from like booked members just from last night, which is unreal. But if you all haven't seen it, like if you check in on your ops and... Kind of how they progressed, like I had Metasource had 60 enrolled last week, they ended at 260. Like, super impressive. Napalm was at like 600 for a while, they ended, or are close to 1200 at this point. Um, so the push has been huge. \nKara Kubarych:\nYeah, and we've had one other quick note there, exactly, we've had very few at this point. We're going to look through all the data today, tomorrow. Um, that has underperformed the expected enrolled significantly, like using 80 as a threshold. Almost all of the mid markets have been at or above, in some cases far above, which is pretty stellar. Um, and of course, there are lots of factors that drive that, um, so so that I think, you know, that's really exciting. There are still a few that we want to keep pushing through the end of this week. So 12 19 is the deadline extension. I think everybody knows that almost everybody got extended. We don't expect there will be like a ton of movement, though. Um, and Yeah, I was just going to say, I think there was a lot of last minute changes or like improvements, which is also just like power of procrastination, which is pretty wild. But yeah, people have like questions or anything you want to flag to me about groups that you are at all concerned about. Please, please do. But again, I think the communication has been really good and appreciate y'all working really closely with implementation managers through this process. Yeah. \nZach Egan:\nThank you, Carol. Maybe we start there. Is there any care that you're seeing that we are, like, tracking well behind on that we should talk about at the top of the call? \nKara Kubarych:\nYeah, let me just look at the latest list here real quick. Oh, what I was going to say, I was like, I know I lost my train of thought on something. Of course, the slack distracted me. We didn't have that expected enrolled number for a few, you know, not that many in the All's cohort. And thank you for kind of queuing it and updating it a few. Weeks ago. I know Zach helped organize that. We've pinged here and there where they've been missing because it's like, not a calculated field, right? So you actually have to add it in Salesforce. So I know a bunch of those have been backfilled. So thank you. But that metric has probably been the most powerful. And I know, like Chris and team have had, Bob definitely eyes on that of like, the expected enrolled versus expected enrolled. So please, please keep filling that out moving forward, it's really helpful. And then if you do have any that are blank, But at this point, I think on this team, we're really good. You know, just continue to add that in because it's been a great stat and we'll build like more scalable reporting around it here. I can share my screen super fast just so people can see this list and then I'll let you all move on. Let me just filter to the relevant groups real quick. \nZach Egan:\nAnd while you do that, Kara, I just dropped the spreadsheet in chat. This team has been... Awesome. I think there's only a handful that are still outstanding. Retsi, it looks like you have about 50, but they're all just the separated Eins from the 30 plus Ein group. So we don't worry about that one. \nKara Kubarych:\nElko did really well, by the way. I think over 100. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOver 100 enrolled? \nKara Kubarych:\nOver 100% expected. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOh, yes. Okay. I was like, that's not what I saw this morning, but that, there we go. Yes. I was like, Oh my God, I'm excited. Yeah, Zach, I did just so, you know, I don't know if Andrew's on this call, but I asked Andrew, about that one. Um, or just about like, could we, um, somehow update the expected based on the enrollment list that we received from the UM? And he was like, I'm gonna try to do that at like a, I'm not manually gonna go into all. \nZach Egan:\nNo, no, no, like track that. \nRetsy Holliday:\nBut Andrew did say he thought he could do this at like a higher level. So we might get a better, we might get better detail there. \nZach Egan:\nYeah, yeah, no worries. And I pinged him this morning as well. I think worst case scenario, we'll just look at the aggregate number for assumed. And just, you know, I don't know if it's if we need to dive into each EIN, if we do this as a whole. So no action. \nKara Kubarych:\nOn that, Zach, really quick. I don't know. I think this is up to date. This is what he put together, and I can ping your all's way as an aggregate. I think this is correct. So this has overall enrollment rate, and then it has the all the EINs. I think those are the four. Is there anyone else that's a multi Ein in this team's cohort that we're missing? \nRetsy Holliday:\nNo, those are my two. \nZach Egan:\nThat's, yeah, not that I know of. Cool. \nKara Kubarych:\nSo, yeah, let me share this, because this is actually like a great little thing, he spun up. Go ahead. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYeah, just I just see it right there. The belonging medical group that are like. Partners That's one of mine that has two eins. Yeah, okay, sweet. \nKara Kubarych:\nSo yeah, this, I think, is probably better. Like it was just too hard to merge into that sheet, but keep going. \nZach Egan:\nZACH Yeah, that's good. Yeah, if we're good here, we can. Just like Rets, I can use this, or Andrew can use this to update that you don't need to worry about it. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOkay, thank you. \nZach Egan:\nAnd then the only other ones I saw in here, Uh, Sully, you had a handful, uh, if you can pop into the doc that I put in chat, it's rows 17 through 19. And then an expected enrollment was not like a required field. It's basically, uh, the purpose is, if we think it's going to vary from the assumed enrollment. Like what they had last year, like, let's say they had 100 enrolled last year, but then they like, aggressively slashed their benefits. They're offering like silver one at 70 we think will be a dip. It's it's our best, like crack at what we think it should be. So that way the CS team can go in and be like they're they're tracking behind. But it's actually in line with what's expected, based on Sully's conversations, right? Maybe we shouldn't push super hard in this group, things like that. Cool, exactly, yeah. \nAndrew Solomon:\nI had a question on that. Because I went back. And I just double checked to make sure that they were in salesforce and they weren't. They were in salesforce, but they weren't porting over. So should you want me to show this manually, Adam here? \nZach Egan:\nYeah, you could. Was it the expected enrollment field that was filled out? I think there's like three different enrollment fields. \nAndrew Solomon:\nYeah, there's like, assumed and then expected. I'd made sure that they were all filled in. Um, so I don't know if they just weren't pulling over, but I'll go in here and double check them and add them. \nZach Egan:\nOkay, I'm looking now and I'm not seeing it as right here. Let me grab the screen share real quick. \nKara Kubarych:\nYeah, and then I think we're looking at something similar, but I'll come back to my list. I was just filtering Andrew's latest because he just dropped this in, like, Uh, I'm looking right here. \nZach Egan:\nSally on the right. Expected enrollments. Yeah. \nAndrew Solomon:\nI might have called out the one I didn't do. I see. \nKara Kubarych:\nHey, it's helpful. \nZach Egan:\nNo, thank you. \nAndrew Solomon:\nSeriously. \nZach Egan:\nFor mine, I knocked mine out this morning. I had like a handful that were blank. So, no, it's not a required field. So no worries. \nAndrew Solomon:\nI gotcha. \nZach Egan:\nAll right, team. Kara, anything else you want to chat over? \nKara Kubarych:\nNo, let me hear. Now that I've got this filter down to what I... Have been generally looking at, let me just pull this up and then I'll keep running. I don't think there's anything that will be super surprising on here. Oh, here. The other thing is, let's look at all the ones that are end date of 1215. You can see this interesting dance that we've all been doing. All right. So I think, I think this should be the right cohort. But yeah, looking in here. So, like Red Sea, I guess we didn't have it for Lund Stoller. Does that sound, right? \nRetsy Holliday:\nExpected enrollment? We did. I manually put this in, too. It was supposed to be 140 and we're at 177. \nKara Kubarych:\nOkay, amazing. Well, we're doing super great for whatever reason. And again, some of this, I think, is just systems wonkiness. And then Zach, perfect game. Did you have that one? \nZach Egan:\nIt should be in there. Expected was like a 130, and it just eclipsed that last night. Amazing. \nKara Kubarych:\nOkay. So minus those, the only one that's a little bit low, but when you add them up, Tom, is the, these two. So I think their total is at like 90 something percent. And I know they were, were tough. So that was huge. Arc ended in a really good spot. Metasource was challenging, and they came up significantly. 3G, Dennis came up to 92, which was a big increase, and they were really low there for a while. And then I think I just pulled out some of. Um, your all of yours, Retzi. I can pull them back. I just was trying to hide those couple. Um, uh, so I don't know now what's going on. All the sphinx and Elko, Yeah, yeah, I think yours are all. Maybe just to let you guys get back to your meeting. Anything you want to shout out or concerned about? Retzi? \nRetsy Holliday:\nNo, no, no, no. I think they're both good. I know Elko's in a good spot. I think Sphinx is like one employee across every location. It's like going to be hard to, we'll see where we shake out. They had 45 previously enrolled out of 400, and they thought that there was going to be an increase in enrollment on thatch. So I think I bumped it up by like 10 e's from previous enrollment. But no, I don't think there's much more we can do there. Okay. \nKara Kubarych:\nAnd I realize there are a couple of 1222s in here. Okay. Well, if, for whatever reason, people want to try to add backfill these couple one more time in Salesforce, go for it. But otherwise, yeah, the numbers are really good. And we'll do another push on a handful of these through end of week. So yeah, good stuff. Awesome. \nZach Egan:\nThanks, Kara. And before we jump into it, Retsi, I think we should start with Len Stoller's group, just so everyone's on the same page with the recent... Medicare conversations as well. I'll let you give, like the general overview of maybe like the speed bump we're facing. And then we'll kind of game plan as a group on what we could potentially do to help them out. Even though it looks kind of tight. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, I mean the from an enrollment perspective, they've blown it out of the water. We were 140 previously enrolled, we're at 177 as of today, so that's great. There, um, I made it very clear, like six times, to the broker, that the owners could not. Len Stoller himself could not participate on the plan. Um, Len Stoller is 95 years old, and then Len Stoller's son, I guess, is like 68 years old. Um, and so they're both going on to Medicare, so it has been pretty, um, this is a new broker for us. And he, uh, he is um old school and wants like, a lot of support and a lot of handholding. And so we've had many calls about how he needs to go support these two guys get on Medicare plans. His as a very generous offer, Jeremy gave Shelly, the Medicare agent, to the son, Barry, so that he could get enrolled on Medicare. And now, as of yesterday, the broker is telling me he just realized that. The 95 year old Len Stoller is on the group plan and hasn't been set up to be like, get onto a Medicare plan yet. So it's just creating. Some, some stress. Um, Andy is just a high anxiety kind of guy and so he brings a lot of that energy into everything that we do. Um, so I gave him Jeremy's personal calendar like Calendly Link today to meet with Jeremy and talk to him. Um, I mean, in this situation like, I think the overall feedback that is relevant for this call is that our Medicare, uh, workflow right now is not sufficient. It's it is not, and we got to witness that on site, for anybody who went on site like it was. You know, you're pushing the population who is the most tech challenged to go use tech. And you would think that, like, you know, scheduling a calendly link isn't that hard, but for that population, it is. Um, opening a computer is overwhelming for some of those folks. And so, um, we are working through this now, I think we've been called out rightfully. So by the broker that the Medicare process we have today is not sufficient and does not actually support this population. So we are working through this. But I think the S-Corp owners and needing Medicare support from them is more of like, I put this a little bit on the broker. Like, the broker needs to own this. But we are doing our best to also support him because he is just a very, he's an anxious dude. And he really is looking to us to guide him through this process because it's his first ICRA. \nZach Egan:\nDid the call get scheduled with Jeremy today? \nRetsy Holliday:\nI haven't heard back yet. I sent him the calendly link and have not gotten a response yet. So it might just resolve itself. That's my hope. Is that Andy and I don't talk today? That's not going to happen. Yeah, probably not. No, we're like, around, we're averaging five times a day right now. So, you know, it is what it is. But I think it's a good, it's a good call out. We have a gap in our business right now. Medicare is not, our Medicare workflow is not sufficient for that population right now. \nZach Egan:\nYeah. \nKara Kubarych:\nAnd I think. Can I ask you a quick question? Is it, Retsi, and I totally hear you, lots of issues with Medicare, escalations, all sorts of things. Do you think it's largely around the product and people not knowing how to make an account and, like, go through the form and schedule with an advisor? Or is it the advisor availability? Or is it that we're giving like misinformation or lack of information on what is required for Medicare enrollment? Like, do you have a sense of, like, what the biggest buckets are? \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, I mean, I think that you nailed them. I think number one is actually number one is that like people who come like, we had somebody come in, in person at Elko, who has chosen to be on group and not on Medicare. And when we told her, that was no longer an option. She was furious. She literally got very angry and walked out on us. And so I think, like one, this is not a thatch thing. This is an icra thing. When you go onto an ICRA, you have to, if you are Medicare eligible, you have to go on Medicare. And so I actually think it's probably something in the sales cycle that we all need to be doing a little bit more education and talking about more upfront. Hey guys, your Medicare eligible employees have to go on to thatch. It's not an option. Also what the, and we talk a lot about like, and what that means from an allowance perspective and turning QME on and off. But we don't talk about, like, this is what it's going to look like for those employees. Here's a full deck that, like, and I think the CS team does have those assets that come in during implementation, but it needs to be more upfront. It needs to be shared earlier on in the sales cycle so that it isn't such a surprise, especially if they have a large Medicare population. And then I really like, I think at the end of the day, the workflow itself, Kara, like when you go in and first, yes, creating an account, Like, we had one woman at Elko literally sit down and point to the computer and say, I don't know how to do that. And she's literally talking about opening a computer. Like, it is very overwhelming for this population to have to find something in their email, click on that link, go create their account. And then from there, the two options, the workflow options are. Enter your information into this Google form. That's hard. Like, I sat next to somebody and walked her through how to do that. And she had her Social Security page with her right there in that moment and, like, had all of the information she needed. She still didn't feel comfortable doing this by herself. And then I think, when you bring, if you need to go shopping for a plan, The fact that, like, we were on site and then we were like, oh, you're going to meet with a Medicare agent in four days from now. They were like, no, I don't want to meet with a Medicare agent in four days from now. I'm here now to get this done. And I don't want to wait. And so I think it's a combination of everything that you said, Kara. But I, you know, those are like the bigger buckets that, I would say, are the pain points. The feedback that I have received from multiple brokers now is you need a phone number for the Medicare population. They know how to use a cell phone. They know how to call somebody. That is what they are comfortable doing. Push like multiple people at Elko told us, we don't have laptops. So like, we set up phone. Literally, Megan is a freaking rock star on products. She sat down and downloaded Google Meet on somebody's cell phone so that they could meet with the advisor in four days from when we met with them. But I don't think anything's going to come from that. Like, they're, they're not able to enter anything onto their phone. They're not, they're confused on how to do that. So I think a phone number is how you solve it for this population. \nKara Kubarych:\nYeah. And yeah. \nZach Egan:\nAnd we are between this group. We are going to have a phone number next year and it is in the works. Amazing. We're not. Talking about it, or like, making promises now, because that timeline is very TBD. But that's the top priority for Gary. And it's for this exact reason, amongst many other reasons. Do I think it'll, like, solve all of these problems? no, but it'll give them someone who can perhaps direct them on how to do it. Um, I think the most challenging thing. That development I've seen as of late is like, my personal understanding of how we support in the Medicare front was just not correct. Like I, since that began, spoke to our prospects, saying, hey, we help folks enroll in parts A and B. We do not. We can help with part D and supplementals, but the onus is on the individual. And I think the biggest pushback I've heard is for brokers, some of them are equipped to do this. Some feel like it shouldn't be their job. But even for that individual to like, okay, now how do I go to the Social Security office? Any guidance that we can provide would be helpful. So what we are working on, I met with the Medicare team. We're going to have, they're working on a one pager right now that we're going to send in every single sales cycle. Uh, if it's a post, you know, follow-up email and it's like, Hey, you must read this, this is important. And then, at the end of the day, those doesn't fix everything. We can say, like, Hey, we can point back to a piece of paper that said, we told you how it was going to work, right? So some of it isn't like a thatch problem as much as like, you know, the onus is on them as well to do some education. So we're going to get better during the sales cycle, But that starts with us fully understanding how we support on that front, which is, like, honestly, been a moving target over the past couple months. So I'll keep working with that team and we're going to have something early January. We can start shipping out there. \nRetsy Holliday:\nAnd is that true? \nDenis Kalamar:\nYeah, because. \nKara Kubarych:\nYeah. Yeah. \nDenis Kalamar:\nSo it's actually not you like, not illegal for 65 and above. You can actually still enroll into an ACA plan if you're 65 and older. It's just going to be more, it's going to be cheaper if you go to the Medicare route, and it's going to be better benefits. But this is something that Julia and I are seeing for 3G is because the Medicare rep actually kind of screwed up the timing. And they're not going to actually be enrolled into the Medicare plan until the end of January or further. And so in the meantime, he actually enrolled into an ACA plan, and he's like 67, and he's doing that for the seven Medicare folks. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOh, interesting. As like a stop gap. So, like, they're actually going to, like Healthcare.gov, signing up for a plan there. They'll reimburse that in the interim until the Medicare plan comes out of the platform and then they can switch it. Or is that, yeah? Do you need a qualifying life event to be able to switch from the AC, like the on exchange plan to this Medicare Plan or no? \nDenis Kalamar:\nThat's what we're trying to figure out right now. The hub Medicare person, like, actually enrolled it and he said it should be fine. But. But the issue is is that if you're enrolled in an ACA plan, like, you're in the Medicare enrollment process and then you sign up for an ACA plan. That's not legally compliant. But if you don't start the enrollment process, then you can sign up for the ACA plan. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOh, interesting. But don't they need to get their applications in now in order to? \nDenis Kalamar:\nIt's only six months within the time frame of when they're Medicare eligible. So, six months previously and six months post. Okay. So that's why, like. I think that just the guidance on kind of what we're saying as sales reps needs to align with, kind of. like, because we've been getting called out a few times from Medicare reps. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, no doubt. So you're saying my 95 year old is not going to be able, this wouldn't work for my 95 year old. Since he's been eligible for Medicare for 30 years. \nDenis Kalamar:\nHonestly, like, I don't have full confidence in anything. Medicare. Like, I'm just like going around the channel. It's like, but I do know. 65 and above, you can go to the ACA marketplace. You don't have to enroll into Medicare if you don't want to. Okay. All right. \nRetsy Holliday:\nGood to know. \nKara Kubarych:\nAlso, just share, this doesn't answer all the questions and definitely a lot more to discuss, But this support page has been updated with some of the FAQs we've been getting during OEP. So some of these questions are in there. I wouldn't say the answers are all spot on or fully helpful yet, but this is worth taking a scan through. And then, yeah, I know so. Lauren, Jeremy and Hillary joined our CST meeting. Or we did like a little one-off training with them last week, and there was like, so much more we didn't even get to. But um, I know that I am got a little bit more clarity there, so feel free to collab, um, on that topic as well in the near term. \nZach Egan:\nOkay, cool, um, and yeah, we're gonna do a train with that team,'s gonna need a training. And we'll have the updated like customer facing docs in early Jan, is the plan. So that'll be something we all need to align on and figure it out. Cause I think everyone thinks about it a little bit differently. Um, all right. Pipeline a little bit lighter one today. Cause we're only focused on two ones. Um, there's a lot in here that is like three ones and four ones. We're only going to focus on two ones. So let's start with the only one in due diligence, Red Sea with Tiro. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, so this one is the one that Caitlin and I have been working for a while now. He went to Amsterdam to meet with the co-founders and was like, hey, we're not making decisions fast enough, but we are still excited about that. So we're checking in with him this week, feeling decent about it. This is a group who's not offering benefits today. So it's just a question of, like, are they willing to pull the trigger for 2-1 or are they going to continue to drag their feet? They came to us because they want to offer benefits to retain and attract talent. Like, that is their goal. So, strategically, that hasn't changed. It's just a matter of whether or not they want to fork up money for this right now, or if it ends up happening later in the year. \nZach Egan:\nYeah. OK. And I think, given 2.1 is, like, important, more so for us than for them, I think you could proactively be like, hey, like. And you could even do like the classic sales type conversation where it's like, you know, hey, our end of year is 2.1. We're incentivized as sellers to bring on as much business as possible. So, with that being said, like, we're willing to discount x percent if you're willing to move now versus mid-year. And we can make that like. \nRetsy Holliday:\nWe've already matched their venture Peppum. So we're at a $20 peppum right now with them. \nZach Egan:\nAnd no broker? \nRetsy Holliday:\nNo broker. \nZach Egan:\nYeah. I mean. \nRetsy Holliday:\nGo lower. \nZach Egan:\nI, if we, if we need to, I think we'd be willing to go as low as we possibly can to make this. A two one versus a three one, for sure. Cool. \nRetsy Holliday:\nSo I will talk to Michael this week. \nZach Egan:\nCool. Um, all right. And then, uh, next Resi KMC wraps auto home life are all. There's two ones. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYep, yep, KMC is a, uh, split off of lazy boy, it's all of the non-lazy boy branded furniture. Um, they're starting their own business, and so Caitlyn and I have done the cost analysis with the UM founders. They're great guys, they're super interested in that um, and very lovely to chat with. I will say our quote like we did every variation, dynamic MAC, MAC, flat cost. And we are still coming in like $200,000, $300,000 more than what they were expecting to spend. But they're also getting the same quotes from group. And so it sounds like we're definitely in the running. But we have not, I don't know. We presented the quote on like Thursday of last week. So we told them to go play around with it. They are going to do carve out. So they have hourly, part-time. And then they have incentive based sellers. So we've done different quotes for each group. And we're working through the process with them of evaluating each quote. So we shall see. \nZach Egan:\nThe renewal is 2-1? \nRetsy Holliday:\nThey're not, they don't need, sorry, they're creating like a new business. And so the business, yeah, they're like, there is no renewal. They're technically a Virgin group, but they are coming from Lazy Boy. \nZach Egan:\nOkay. And in comparison to the like, lazy Boy. Census, or numbers, were 200k more expensive? \nRetsy Holliday:\nWe're actually more like three to 400k. But they said that that is what they've been getting quoted in the group space. So they said that they had one quote that was much lower than us, but the quality of benefits was much worse. So I'm going to be real. The numbers don't look great for them. And honestly, the employee experience is not great either. Like when we did our disruption employee net, like our actual analysis, doing a silver one or a silver 25 for some of these groups was not. Employees were not in a great spot and so we explained that to them. And they get to decide whether or not they want to increase their budget or if they're okay with that. Um, but they did say they are using benefits as a way to retain the talent that they are taking away from. \nZach Egan:\nLazy Boy Gotcha, Okay? And they're on their own internal payroll system. \nRetsy Holliday:\nUh, yes, they have their own in-house. \nZach Egan:\nYeah, we won't, we won't cut our hopes up, but we'll keep it close. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, I'm going to check in with them this week. They're really genuine and kind. And, like, I know that they'll be real with us, and whether or not this is realistic. Yeah. \nZach Egan:\nOK. Next one on here is RAPS. \nRetsy Holliday:\nSo met with them. This is the there's 85 Medicare eligible employees. This is the one I called you about, Zach. Yeah. So, yeah, we pushed them to a 2-1 because obviously they called us last week and wanted to do a 1-1 and we said no. And they're very interested and very intrigued. The numbers for a group, the average age of this group is like 59 years old. It's, yeah, it's an interesting cohort of employees. But that being said, the quote is actually very competitive. They're super interested. They are concerned about the Medicare experience. I'm going to be very transparent. They're like, wait, what are they going to have to do? How are these employees going to go through that workflow? But I'm pinging. I back channeled the paychecks rep and told her that. Realistically, we would like a decision by the end of this week, early next week, if we want a successful 2-1 with this group. \nZach Egan:\nYeah, so, and okay, and then knowing what we know about Medicare, or like, kind of know at this point. Uh, I, I want to talk to Jeremy and just be like, what other questions do we need to ask? Because if we're going to support the 85, um, I just, I mean, we could do. Foresee it now. Like, we'll get them in there and then there'll be like, some question will come our way of, like, Hey, are they all, you know? Do they already go through Social security process or whatever it is? So, yeah, um, we'll just get, uh, I'll make a note just to, like, get ahead of the Medicare piece and like, actually work for that team to formalize a plan. \nRetsy Holliday:\nCool if it, it makes everybody feel a little bit better, he did. The owner did say he thinks about 10 of the 85 would actually enroll, and he's like, the rest of them would unlikely enroll. So, um. You know, that obviously that 10 is a digestible number. 85 is not. And so I'm not as concerned after our second call when he said he thinks only 10 would actually enroll. \nZach Egan:\nOkay, perfect. That's super nice. All right. Anything we can do to support there? Otherwise, your last one on here. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYep. Home life. Yes, there it is. Yeah. Home life. Um, USI Referral had a lovely call with the decision makers last week. She was emailing me over the weekend asking me for like, how do I see SBCs? and, um, asking for the quote again on a different monitor. So they're definitely playing around with it. They're very intrigued. Um, the USI, USI team feels like this is their only option. The Home Life's team, only option that would make sense for them next year. And I am. I've sent a note to the USI brokers today asking for whether or not they think it's realistic for us to have a decision by end of week as well. So feeling decent about that one, probably out of the three, that is the highest likelihood here of moving forward. Okay, sweet. \nZach Egan:\nAnything the CPM team can do on the USI front sounds like they're like fully bought in. They're great. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, we have a great relationship with Casey and Chris, and they're definitely advocating for us. They're actually sidebarring us and asking questions about that as well. So they're super engaged and we're feeling like a good co-selling team right now. \nZach Egan:\nCool. Kara K, Do we, I know we sent out, is Kara still here? Maybe not. \nJulia Korzeniowski:\nMaybe doing something. Okay. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nOn mute, but she might be here. Okay. \nZach Egan:\nIf you're there or Julia, you might be able to help. I know we sent like a lot of gifts to brokers. I don't think it was current clients. It was just brokers recently. And, like, we had the gift box. Is that, like, can we do those as one officer? Was that like a mass shipment through Allie and her team that we weren't involved in? \nJulia Korzeniowski:\nWe did a mass send, but I do know that. Your tweet and we can send one off. And he created a channel this week, and Chad is in it clearly, um, asking if there were any one-offs. She also said she had a few extra gifts laying around. \nZach Egan:\nSo shall we rip one to this USI crew team? \nChad Schneider:\nWe have it, that'd be great. \nZach Egan:\nOkay to do that. There's a workflow, it, it sounds like. Jules and Chad. \nChad Schneider:\nYeah. Just send me the, the info for the guy. I'll get it in there. \nRetsy Holliday:\nPerfect. Thanks, Chad. Nice. \nZach Egan:\nAll right. And then, Tom, this is the mid year one. Mine's mid year. We're looking light on two ones, which means we cleaned it up, which is good. Dennis, Oh, LFC, meeting last week was Thanks. Was good. What was what the next steps look like? Here? \nDenis Kalamar:\nI have a meeting with them for the middle of January to kind of evaluate it with their broker. They're not in a huge rush for a 2-1, but I do think that for a 3-1 this could be potential as well. \nZach Egan:\nOkay, so we're meeting in mid-January is the next call. Yeah, so let's, I'm just gonna move it out. Just given. Like if we meet, even if we get like the verbal on January 15th. Like we would have already need to start enrollment for a 2-1, right? \nDenis Kalamar:\nAnd so that's, that's like a lot of these, like larger ones, where it's either self-funded groups. It's just not realistic to try and get a commitment at the beginning. And especially because they have, I think, 25 Medicare, Medicare eligible employees in New York. Yeah. \nZach Egan:\nOkay. Well, we'll table it for now, then. Any, that kind of sums up the two ones. So we just have a handful in flight. Anything else from the team that's relevant for. A 2-1. We're looking tight on pipeline, folks. All right. Well, I think it's expected. This happened last year, too. I can probably count, on one hand, how many 2-1s were actually in play for mid-market. So, with that being said, this LFC1, Dennis, anything that's a 3-1 or early next year, like, that's just where our energy is going to need to pivot. Like, it's very unlikely we can pull these up unless we can somehow incentivize if we're moving our pep them down to, you know, 10, But not for LLC specifically. Dennis. I mean, like any other ones around that three, one timeframe, four ones, where it's like, Hey, if you lock in now, we can get you like a $10 pep on things like that. Very open and willing to do that. But like, obviously this is an interesting space where we, not like traditional software, where you can make that move anytime you want. So. Um, yeah, we'll keep doing what we can for these couple of two ones, that'll be the focus and everything else we're on to early next year. Any questions, comments, concerns from the squad? \nDenis Kalamar:\nThe Providence Network? Is that going to be updated within the new quoting tool, Cory said, potentially by the end of the month. Do we have, like, a little bit more of a solid timeline for that? \nZach Egan:\nI do not know. I can check with. You're asking if the new the quoting tool will have those updates. Yeah. \nDenis Kalamar:\nHonestly, it should. \nZach Egan:\nBut let me, let me make a note to pin Corey about that. \nDenis Kalamar:\nOK. I have a couple opportunities specifically, like in the Tahoe, El Dorado and Nevada area, that the Providence network expansion would make a huge. \nZach Egan:\nUm, and therefore for next year, I take it. \nDenis Kalamar:\nYeah, well, one of them have scored two, one. I just don't think realistically it makes sense with them. Until we get like those numbers to even kind of formulate, even proposing a two one uh transition. But I do think maybe a mid-year. This is for Edgewood, um, Edgewood companies. \nZach Egan:\nOkay, I think if let's, let's act like it's live, uh, I'll get more intel to make sure like we'll be available by 2.1, But even if it doesn't like populate in the tool, if we're still hinting out, like, hey, by the time they enroll, they're also going to have providence, that could be enough. But let me get more clarification from Corey before we go too deep there. \nDenis Kalamar:\nAll right. Sounds good. All right. \nZach Egan:\nAnything else, team? \nTom Hemmingsen:\nDoes anyone have deals for like 4.1, 5.1? Maybe just for one that are like tracking well that we could book in January? \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, I got one. I'm pushing hard on L.J. Rogers and offering 2025 pricing to try to get that done, even though I'm kind of, you know, not sure what 2026 pricing looks like, but I'm offering 2025 pricing. But it's good. It's 210, 110 enrolled, or 108 enrolled. It's a trucking company based out of North Carolina. So we, Caitlin and I spent an hour with them. We've done the initial pitch and then Caitlin and I spent an hour with them last week to do their like full employee disruption analysis. So it went really well. They were excited. No, I made that up, Dennis. fails. So they were very excited about the employee disruption analysis. And then Danielle called me yesterday and said that. She's doing another meeting with them on it and this week or early next week. So I'm pushing hard to get them to sign. I said, you just need to sign the contract by 2-1 and get preferred pricing. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYeah. I mean, even though fiscal, you know, fiscal ends. 2-1 just for the team, like any bookings, you know, before 2-1 is obviously things that will improve our fiscal year. So hopefully we get some more of these in the coming weeks as well. \nRetsy Holliday:\nTom, that was one question for me was like, we book it, we get the contract signed by 2-1, but then enrollments 4-1. Do those enrolled lives count for 2025 enrolled lives or for 2026? 2026. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nBut in terms of like, you know, our business, especially next year, as we continue to move up market, like bookings are going to become more and more important, right? So like Q1. Of next year. We're obviously want to get a lot of enrollments based off whatever our numbers are, but the more bookings we can let. Level on top of that is is beneficial too. So um, so yeah, it's always like, top, actually enrolled is best, that's real revenue. But you know, we've, we've shown that also, like when people sign contracts with us, like, for the most part, our hit rate is very strong on those. So, um, but yeah, it'd be, it'd be just like something we could tell, you know, investors and the board and stuff. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nCool, it's a question. It's a little random. If we have spare time, go for it. So for some deals that are like Land and Expand, have we considered how the AES will be involved? Like, Brett C and I just got off of this deal that has one person in New Mexico. So there's stuff coming to us for a carve out, But it would be beneficial for her to remain involved since she already has all of the context. And right now, the way our team is structured is that CS should be owning that, but really, it's a little outside of their scope. Cause, as far as I know, and feel free to correct me, if this is changing, there is no real incentive for upsells. So are we considering that as we're going forward and growing as a business? \nZach Egan:\nSo. Yes, absolutely. And we've hinted the idea of a potential account management team that owns renewals and upsells. And that's their sole purpose, which has been how I've seen it in traditional Saas in the past. It is still very up in the air. I think right now the goal is to get sales reps out of the sales cycle so they can focus on the next new business. But in this case, I had a group called Embeda. I wanted to do a Texas carve out with like five people, but they were 250. And it's like, as a sales rep, I selfishly also want to be involved in that. So I think as those come up now and with no structure in place, let's just take them as one-offs. Like, honestly, like rats, if you want to be involved post-sale on that one, like, I would just say, let's partner with, you know, Julia and Karen, the CS team, to make sure we're all like, lockstep on this. Or, like, if you come to periodic check-ins to help out, how you can. Awesome. But. We also, we just gotta get on the same page with the teams, but for now, current state, I'm all for it. If it's going to lead to expansion. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nThanks, that makes sense. And I wouldn't be surprised if that's the way some of the larger groups also approach it, just knowing that it's a change. \nZach Egan:\nFor sure. I think, yeah, we'll see what future of Thatch looks like, too. And like the enterprise space, like, you know, if you're holding on to just a handful of accounts and focusing on upsells, like, there's... Right now, the main way that we upsell is increased enrollment. And there's also potential changes in the future with the marketplace. But yeah, it's in the adolescent stages of any kind of plan. So we'll just do it as a one-off for now. Thank you. All right, squad. Anything else? See you out there. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nThank you. \nRetsy Holliday:\nThanks, guys. \n",

Action Items\n- Zach → Work with Medicare team to create one-pager explaining Medicare support process for sales cycle → Early January 2025\n- Zach → Schedule Medicare workflow training for sales team with updated customer-facing docs → Early January 2025\n- Zach → Confirm with Corey if Providence network expansion will be available in quoting tool by 2/1 → This week (by 12/20/2025)\n- Zach → Consult with Jeremy on additional Medicare questions to ask prospects before onboarding → This week (by 12/20/2025)\n- Retsy → Follow up with Tiro (Michael) and offer additional discount for 2/1 vs mid-year start → This week (by 12/20/2025)\n- Retsy → Check in with KMC on quote evaluation → This week (by 12/20/2025)\n- Retsy → Get decision timeline from Paychex rep for Wraps → End of week (by 12/20/2025)\n- Retsy → Follow up with USI team on Home Life decision timeline → End of week (by 12/20/2025)\n- Retsy → Push LJ Rogers to sign contract by 2/1 with 2025 pricing offer → By 2/1/2025\n- Chad → Send gift to USI broker team (Casey and Chris) → ASAP\n- Denis → Follow up with LFC in mid-January for 3/1 evaluation → Mid-January 2025\n- Team → Update expected enrollment fields in Salesforce for any remaining gaps → Ongoing\n- Product Team → Develop phone support solution for Medicare population → 2025 (timeline TBD)\n\n5. Notes\n- Medicare Process Gaps: Current workflow requires tech-savvy users; Medicare-eligible population struggles with: creating accounts, filling Google forms, scheduling via Calendly, and using computers/smartphones. Phone support is top priority for 2025.\n- Sales Cycle Education Needed: Medicare eligibility requirements (must enroll in Medicare when ICHRA-eligible) need to be communicated earlier in sales process, not just during implementation\n- Pricing Flexibility: Team authorized to discount PEPM significantly (down to $10) to secure 2/1 deals vs later start dates\n- ACA Workaround Discovered: 65+ individuals CAN enroll in ACA plans (not illegal), though Medicare is typically cheaper with better benefits; being used as stopgap for 3G group with Medicare enrollment delays\n- Account Management Structure: No formal process yet for AE involvement in upsells/expansions; handling as one-offs with CS team collaboration for now\n- Fiscal Year Impact: Bookings before 2/1 improve fiscal year results even if enrollment is later (4/1, 5/1)\n\nGranola Summary\n\nObjectives So Far:\n- Review Q1 2025 pipeline and enrollment performance across mid-market team\n- Address Medicare workflow challenges impacting client experience\n- Identify and prioritize 2/1 start date opportunities\n- Align on process improvements for Medicare-eligible populations\n\nProgress Made:\n- Exceptional OEP enrollment results: 300K+ ARR booked, most groups at/above 80% expected enrollment\n- Identified critical Medicare workflow gaps through on-site client experiences\n- Cleaned up pipeline; most groups extended to 12/19 deadline\n- Strong broker relationships established (USI, Paychex)\n- Multiple competitive quotes delivered (KMC, Wraps, Home Life, Tiro)\n\nOutstanding Issues:\n- Medicare Workflow: No phone support; tech barriers for 65+ population; unclear guidance on Parts A/B enrollment process\n- Sales Cycle Communication: Medicare requirements not adequately explained upfront, causing client frustration\n- Limited 2/1 Pipeline: Few realistic 2/1 opportunities remaining; need to pivot to 3/1 and beyond\n- Product Gaps: Medicare support page needs updates; quoting tool may not reflect Providence network expansion\n- Process Uncertainty: No formal structure for AE involvement in upsells/renewals\n\nNext Steps:\n- Develop Medicare one-pager and training materials for sales team (Early Jan 2025)\n- Implement phone support solution for Medicare population (2025 priority)\n- Push remaining 2/1 opportunities with aggressive pricing (by 12/20/2025)\n- Shift focus to 3/1 and 4/1 pipeline development\n- Improve upfront education about Medicare requirements in sales cycle\n- Confirm Providence network availability in quoting tool\n- Send broker gifts and maintain strong partner relationships"

The meeting focused on Q1 2025 enrollment performance, Medicare workflow challenges, and pipeline opportunities for 2/1/2025 and beyond.\n\nKey Discussion Points\n\n1. Enrollment Performance & 2026 Considerations\n- Strong Q1 Performance: Mid-market groups exceeded enrollment expectations, with most groups at or above 80% of expected enrollment\n- Notable Successes:\n  - MetaSource: Grew from 60 to 260 enrolled\n  - NEPPA: Reached ~1,200 enrolled (from 600)\n  - LenStoler: 177 enrolled vs. 140 expected (127% of target)\n  - Elco: Over 100% of expected enrollment\n- Deadline Extension: Most groups received extension to 12/19/2025 for final enrollment\n\n2. Medicare Workflow Challenges (Critical Issue)\nMajor Pain Points Identified:\n- Current Medicare enrollment process is insufficient for the Medicare-eligible population\n- Technology barriers: Many Medicare-eligible employees struggle with creating accounts, using computers, and navigating digital forms\n- Key Insight: This population needs phone support, not digital-only workflows\n- Employees want immediate assistance, not scheduled appointments 4+ days out\n- Lack of clear guidance on Parts A & B enrollment process\n\nSpecific Examples:\n- LenStoler: 95-year-old owner and 68-year-old son need Medicare support; broker (Andy) requires significant handholding\n- Elco: On-site experience revealed employees unable to use computers; one employee walked out when told she couldn't stay on group plan\n- WRAPS: 85 Medicare-eligible employees (though only ~10 expected to enroll)\n\n3. Sales Cycle Improvements Needed\n- Medicare education must happen earlier in sales process, not just during implementation\n- Need clear documentation that Medicare-eligible employees MUST transition to Medicare under ICRA (not optional)\n- Sales reps need better training on what Thatch does/doesn't support for Medicare enrollment\n\nStakeholders Identified\n\nInternal Thatch Team\n- Zach Egan: Sales team lead, facilitating pipeline review\n- Kara Kubarych: CS/Implementation oversight, tracking enrollment metrics\n- Retsy Holliday: AE managing multiple accounts (LenStoler, Elco, FX, Tiro, KMC, WRAPS, Home Life, LJ Rogers)\n- Denis Kalamar: AE managing 3G, LFC\n- Tom Hemmingsen: Sales leadership\n- Andrew Solomon: Sales operations/systems\n- Kaitlin Zidar: AE, co-selling with Retsy\n- Patricia Gorla, Donny Ho: Team members\n\nMedicare Support Team\n- Jeremy: Medicare specialist providing direct support\n- Shelly: Medicare agent\n- Hillary, Lauren: Additional Medicare support staff\n\nExternal Stakeholders (Brokers/Partners)\n- Andy: LenStoler broker (high-anxiety, requires significant support)\n- Casey & Chris: USI brokers (strong co-selling relationship on Home Life deal)\n- Paychex rep: Partner on WRAPS opportunity\n\nImportant Milestones & Timestamps\n\nCompleted Milestones\n- 12/15/2025: Original enrollment deadline for most mid-market groups\n- 12/16/2025 (Meeting Date): Pipeline review; over 300K ARR booked from previous night alone\n- Week of 12/9/2025: Cost analysis presentations completed for multiple prospects\n\nUpcoming Critical Dates\n- 12/19/2025: Extended enrollment deadline for mid-market groups\n- End of Week (12/20/2025): Target decision deadline for WRAPS and Home Life\n- Mid-January 2026: LFC evaluation meeting scheduled\n- Early January 2026: \n  - Medicare training for sales team planned\n  - Updated customer-facing Medicare documentation to be released\n  - Medicare one-pager for sales cycle to be completed\n\nFuture Milestones\n- 2/1/2026: Target start date for several pipeline opportunities (Tiro, KMC, WRAPS, Home Life)\n- 4/1/2026: Target for LJ Rogers (offering 2025 pricing as incentive)\n- Q1 2026: Phone support for Medicare population expected to launch (timeline TBD)\n\nActive Pipeline Opportunities\n\n2/1/2026 Start Dates\n\n1.

Yeah, right? \nAndrew Solomon:\nLike mine doesn't add on these internal ones anymore. \nZach Egan:\nI, yeah, we have someone crashing a party. \nAndrew Solomon:\nOh, Uck in Donny. \nDonny Ho:\nOh Duck dude. \nZach Egan:\nYou got some lights in that room or no? \nAndrew Solomon:\nNo. \nDonny Ho:\nThat's a sick day today, so Oh. Oh no, Not, not trying to overstimulate myself. \nZach Egan:\nOh damn dude. No, hopefully you can take it easy. Yeah. \nAndrew Solomon:\nZach, you wanna, you think, I think I know what it is on this invite and Julia's aol.com email is on it. So I think it's recognizing it as there's an external somebody on the call. \nZach Egan:\nI see. I mean, I don't know. I think the most surprising thing is Julia has an A OL account. Exactly. Is a rare Old school. \nAndrew Solomon:\nCool. \nZach Egan:\nDo you know what up? Nothing much. \nDenis Kalamar:\nI have a construction outside the door today, so I don't know how long that's gonna go for. \nZach Egan:\nSan Francisco. Where'd you get that hat? This one? \nDenis Kalamar:\nYeah. It's, it was in the box they sent us a couple, couple months ago. Cool. \nZach Egan:\nMust have been nice. \nAndrew Solomon:\nYeah, It was. It was for new hires, Zach. It was just a couple months late, so I don't think you made the cut. \nZach Egan:\nI see, I see. I missed out on a lot of swags Extras. \nPatricia Gorla:\nNo, this is, the extras are in the meeting room actually right below Inspire optimism meeting room right below the tv. \nZach Egan:\nSnag one In San Francisco, isn't it? That's a different one he's got though. That's like a relaxed fit. There's more. \nAndrew Solomon:\nSend the bar away. Zach. \nZach Egan:\nI, I'm in office so I could figure it out pretty quick. I'll give it a peek. All right, team. Happy Tuesday. I didn't realize there was a product offsite in office. So it's myself and the whole product team somewhere over here. But I wasn't allowed to have the breakfast tacos that were in the kitchen today. I wasn't, it was product only. So you're Y No, they, well I'm not, but then, but then Adler was like, all right Zach, go ahead. So I guess you can, I, I felt I felt guilty but I did eat like three of them, so That's probably why they knew that was coming. Yeah, like this guy can do some damage. All right. Squad little pipeline review action. First and foremost, has everyone updated their two ones? Hers, the request last week is two ones feeling squeaky clean. If not, it's okay. But speak up or forever hold your peace because we need these. I got a thing from Gary this morning that we need these done. Everyone's good. It's all good. Rey. Yeah. Okay, cool. Cool. Kara, how you doing? \nKara Kubarych:\nI'm good. I'm like just starting to pick my head up and think about what's in the pipeline for next year. So yeah, that's exciting also. Huge kudos everyone. I feel like we landed in a really good spot as of last night on all the 1215 mid-market groups, so, so yeah. Good stuff. \nZach Egan:\nWell and ku, kudos to your team Kara, because I think last night we had like over 300 and K, 300 K and a RR from like booked members just from last night, which is unreal. But if y'all haven't seen it, like if you check in on your ops and, and kind of how they progressed. Like I had, MetaSource had 60 enrolled last week. They ended at two 60, like super impressive. NEP PA was at like 600 for a while. They ended or are close to 1200 at this point. So the push has been huge. \nKara Kubarych:\nYeah, and we've had one other quick note there Zach. We've had very few at this point and we're gonna look through all the data today, tomorrow that has underperformed the expected enroll significantly, like using 80% as a threshold. Almost all of the mid markets have been at or above in some cases far above, which is pretty stellar. And of course there are lots of factors that drive that. So, so that I think, you know, that's really exciting. There are still a few that we wanna keep pushing through the end of this week. So 1219 is the deadline extension. I think everybody knows that almost everybody got extended. We don't expect there will be like a ton of movement though. And yeah, I was just gonna say, I think there was a lot of last minute changes or like improvements which is also just like power of procrastination, which is pretty wild. But yeah, if people have like questions or anything you wanna flag to me about groups, you know, that you are at all concerned about, please, please do. But again, I think the communication has been really good and appreciate y'all working really closely with implementation managers through this process. Yeah. \nZach Egan:\nAnd thank, thank you Kara, maybe we start there. Is there any care that you're seeing that we are like tracking well behind on that we should talk about at the top of the call? \nKara Kubarych:\nYeah, let me just look at the latest list here real quick. Oh, what I was gonna say, I was like, I know I lost my train of thought on something. Of course the slack distracted me. We didn't have that expected enrolled number for a few, you know, not that many in Y all's cohort. And, and thank you for kind of queuing it and updating it a few weeks ago. You know, Zach helped organize that We've pinged here and there where they, where they've been missing because there's, it's like not a calculated field, right? So you actually have to add it in Salesforce. So I know a bunch of those have been backfilled, so thank you. But that metric has probably been the most powerful and I know like Chris and and team have had Bob definitely eyes on that of like the expected enroll enrolled versus expected enrolled. So please, please keep filling that out moving forward. It's really helpful. And then if you do have any that are blank but at this point I think on this team we're really good. You know, just continue to add that in 'cause it's been a great stat and we'll build like more scalable reporting around it here. I can share my screen super fast just so people can see this list and then I'll let y'all move on. Let me just filter to the relevant groups real quick. \nZach Egan:\nAnd while you do that, Kara, I just forgot the, the spreadsheet in chat with this team has been awesome. I think there's only a handful that are still outstanding. Rezi, it looks like you have about 50, but they're all just the separated EINs from the 30 plus EN groups. So we exactly, Don't worry, Don't worry about that one. \nKara Kubarych:\nEL Code did really well by the way. I think over a hundred, Over a hundred enrolled Over a hundred percent expected. Oh yes. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOkay. I was like, that's not what I saw this morning, but that that, there we go. Yes. I was like, oh my god, I'm excited. Yeah, Zach, I did. Just so you know, I don't know if Andrew's on this call, but I asked Andrew about that one or just about like, could we somehow update the expected based on the enrollment list that we received from the, and he was like, I'm gonna try to do that at like a, I'm not manually gonna go into all three apps. \nZach Egan:\nNo, no, That's, and like track that. \nRetsy Holliday:\nBut Andrew did say he thought he could do this at like a higher level. So we might get a better, we might get better detail there. \nZach Egan:\nYeah, yeah, no worries. And I, I ping him this morning as well. I think worst case scenario, we'll just look at the the aggregate number. Yeah. For assumed and just, you know, I don't know but it's, it is if we need to dive into each EIN if we just do this as a whole. So, okay. \nKara Kubarych:\nI think yeah, no, no action On on that. Zach, really quick. I don't, I think this is up to date. This is what he put together and I can ping y'all's way as an aggregate. I think this is correct. So this has overall enrollment rate and then it has the all the EINs. I think those are the four. Is there anyone else that's a, a multi EIN and this team's cohort that we're missing? \nRetsy Holliday:\nNo, those are my two. \nZach Egan:\nI'll go and That's, yeah, not that I know of. Cool. \nKara Kubarych:\nSo yeah, let me share this 'cause this is actually like a great little thing. He spun up. Go ahead. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYeah, just I just see it right there. The belonging medical group. Better Life Partners. That's one of mine that has twos. Yeah. \nKara Kubarych:\nOkay. So, so yeah, this I think is probably better. Like it was just too hard to merge into that sheet. But keep going Zach. \nZach Egan:\nYeah, that's good. Yeah, if we're good here we can just like rets I can use this or Andrew can use this to update that. You don't need to worry about it. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOkay, thank you. \nZach Egan:\nAnd then the only other ones that I saw in here, Sully, you had a handful. If you can pop into the doc that I put in chat, it's Rose 17 through 19 And then, and expect enrollment was not like a required field. It's basically the purpose is if we think it's gonna vary from the assumed enrollment, like what they had last year. Like let's say they had a hundred enrolled last year, but then they like aggressively slashed their benefits. They're offering like silver one at 70%, we think there'll be a dip. It's, it's our best like crack at what we think it should be so that way the CS team can go in and be like, hey they're, they're tracking behind, but it's actually in line with what's expected based on Sully's conversations. Right. Maybe we shouldn't push super hard on this group. Things like that. Cool. \nAndrew Solomon:\nExactly. Yeah, I, I had a question on that 'cause I went back and I just double checked to make sure that they were in Salesforce and they weren't port, they were in Salesforce but they weren't porting over. So should you want me, should I just manually add 'em here? \nZach Egan:\nYeah, if you could. Was it the expected enrollment field that was filled out? I think there's like three different enrollment fields. \nAndrew Solomon:\nYeah, There's like assumed and then expected I, I'd made sure that they were all filled in so I don't know if they just weren't pulling over, but I'll go in here and and double check them and add 'em. \nZach Egan:\nOkay. I'm looking now and I'm not seeing it as, oh here, lemme grab the screen share real quick. \nKara Kubarych:\nYeah and then I think we're looking at something similar but I'll come back to my list. I was just filtering Andrew's latest 'cause he just dropped this in Like I'm looking right here. \nZach Egan:\nSully on the right expected enrollments. Yeah. \nAndrew Solomon:\nMight called out the one I didn't do. I see. \nKara Kubarych:\nHey, it's helpful. \nAndrew Solomon:\nNo thank you. Seriously. \nZach Egan:\nI mean I did for mine. I knocked mine out this morning. I had like a handful that were blank so no, it's not a required field so no worries. \nAndrew Solomon:\nI gotcha. \nZach Egan:\nAlright team Kara, anything else you wanna chat over? \nKara Kubarych:\nNo, let me hear now that I've got this filter down to what I have been generally looking at, lemme just pull this up and then I'll, I'll let y'all keep running. I don't think there's anything that will be super surprising on here. Oh here. The other thing is, let's look at all the ones that are end date of 1215. You can see this interesting dance that we've all been doing. All right. So I think, I think this should be the right cohort, but yeah, looking in here. So like Rey, I guess we didn't have it for LenStoler. Does that sound right? \nRetsy Holliday:\nExpected enrollment We did, I put, I manually put this too. It was supposed to be 140 and we're at 177. \nKara Kubarych:\nOkay, amazing. Well we're doing super great for whatever reason. And again some of this I think is just, is just systems wonkiness and then Zach Perfect game. Did you have that one? \nZach Egan:\nIt should be in there. Expected it was like a one 30 and they just eclipsed that last night. Amazing. \nKara Kubarych:\nOkay. So minus those, the only one that's a little bit low, but when you add them up, Tom is is the these two. So I think their total is at like 90 something percent and I know they were were tough. So that was huge. Arc ended in a really good spot. MetaSource was challenging and they came up significantly. 3G Dennis came up to 92, which was a big increase and they were really low there for a while. And then I think I just pulled out some of your, all of yours Resy. I can pull them back. I just was trying to hide those couple so I don't know now what's going On. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOh, all the FX and Elco. \nKara Kubarych:\nYeah. Yeah. So I think yours are all, maybe just to let you guys get back to your meeting, anything you wanna shout out or concerned about Red Z? \nRetsy Holliday:\nNo, no, no, no. I I think they're both, they're they're both good. I know, I know Elco iss in a good spot. I think FX is like one employee across every location. It's like gonna be hard to, we'll see where we shake out. They had 45 previously enrolled out of 400 and they thought that there was going to be an increase in enrollment on thatch. So I think I bumped it up by like 10 es from previous enrollment. But no, I I I, I don't think there's much more we can do there. Okay. \nKara Kubarych:\nAnd I realize there are a couple of 1220 twos in here. Okay. Well if for whatever reason people wanna try to add backfill these couple one more time in Salesforce, go for it. But otherwise, yeah, the numbers are really good and we'll, we'll do another push on a handful of these through end of week. So yeah, good stuff. Awesome. Thanks Kara. \nZach Egan:\nAnd before we jump into it, Resy, I think we should start with Lento is a group just so everyone's on the same page with like the recent Medicare conversations as well. I'll, I'll let you give like the general overview of maybe like the, the speed bump we're facing and then we'll kind of game plan as a group on what we could potentially do to help them out even though it looks kind of tight. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, I mean the, from an enrollment perspective, they've blown it outta the water. We were one 40 previously enrolled. We're at 1 77 as of today, so that's great there. I made it very clear like six times to the broker that the owners could not lento himself, could not participate on the plan. Lento is 95 years old and then Len Stoller's son I guess is like 68 years old. And so they're both going onto Medicare. So it has been pretty, this is a new broker for us and he, he is old school and wants like a lot of support and a lot of handholding. And so we've had many calls about how he needs to go support these two guys get on Medicare plans. His as a very generous offer. Jeremy gave Shelly the Medicare agent to the son Barry so that he could get enrolled on Medicare. And now as of yesterday, the broker is telling me he just realized that the 95-year-old LenStoler is on the group plan and hasn't been set up to be on like get onto a Medicare plan yet. So it's just creating some, some stress. Andy is just a, a high anxiety kind of guy and so he brings a lot of that energy into everything that we do. So I gave him Jeremy's personal calendar link, Calendly link today to meet with Jeremy and talk to him. I mean, in this situation, like I think the overall feedback that is relevant for this call is that our Medicare workflow right now is not sufficient. It's, it is not s and and we got to witness that onsite for anybody who went onsite. Like it was, you know, you're pushing the population who is the most tech challenged to go use tech. And you would think that like, you know, scheduling a Calendly link isn't that hard, but for that population it is, opening a computer is overwhelming for some of those folks. And so we are working through this now. I think we've been called out rightfully so by the broker that the Medicare process we have today is not sufficient and does not actually support this population. So we are working through this, but I think the s-corp owners and needing Medicare support from them is more of like, I I, I put this a little bit on the broker, like the broker needs to own this and, but we are doing our best to also support him because he is just a very, he's an anxious dude and he really is looking to us to guide him through this process 'cause it's his first icra. \nZach Egan:\nSo Did the, did the call get scheduled with Jeremy today? And I haven't heard back yet. \nRetsy Holliday:\nI sent him the calendar link, Calendly link and have not gotten a, a response yet. So it might just resolve itself. That's my hope. Is that right? Is that Andy and I don't talk today, but That's not gonna happen. \nZach Egan:\nYeah, probably not. \nRetsy Holliday:\nNo, we're like around, we're averaging five times a day right now, so, so you know, it is what it is. But I think it's a good, it's a good call out. We have a gap in our business right now. Medicare is not, our Medicare, Medicare workflow is not sufficient for that population right now. \nZach Egan:\nYeah. And I think, Can I ask you a quick question? \nKara Kubarych:\nIs it Resy and I'm, I totally hear you. Lots of issues with Medicare escalations, all sorts of things. Do you think it's largely around, around the product and people not knowing how to make an account and like go through the form and schedule with an advisor? Or is it the advisor availability or is it that we're giving like misinformation or lack of information on what is required for Medicare enrollment? Like do you have a sense of like what the biggest buckets are? \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, I mean I think that you nailed 'em. I think number one is actually number one is that like people who come, like we had somebody come in in person at Elco who has chosen to be on group and not on Medicare. And when we told her that was no longer an option, she was furious. She literally got very angry and walked out on us. And so I think like one, this is not a thatch thing, this is an ICRA thing. When you go onto an icra, you have to, if you are Medicare eligible, you have to go on Medicare. And so I actually think it's probably something in the sales cycle that we all need to be doing a little bit more education and talking about more upfront, Hey guys, your Medicare eligible employees have to go onto thatch. It's not an option. Also what the, you know, and we talk a lot about like allowances and what that means from an allowance perspective and turning QME on and off. But we don't talk about like this is what it's going to look like for those employees. Here's a full deck that like, and, and I think the CS team does have those assets that come in during implementation, but it needs to be more upfront. It needs to be shared earlier on in the sales cycle so that it isn't such a surprise. Especially if they have a large Medicare population. And then I really like, I I think at the end of the day, the workflow itself Kara, like when you go in and first yes. Creating an account, like we had one woman at Elco literally sit down and point to the computer and say, I don't, I don't know how to do that. And she's literally talking about opening a computer. Like it is very overwhelming for this population to have to, to find something in their email, click on that link, go create their account. And then from there the two options, the workflow options are enter this, Google your information into this Google form. That's hard. Like I, I sat next to somebody and walked her through how to do that and she had her social security page with her right there in that moment and like had all of the information she needed. She still didn't feel comfortable doing this by herself. And then I think when you bring, if you need to go shopping for a plan, the fact that like we were on site and then we were like, oh, you're gonna meet with a Medicare agent in four days from now. They were like, no, I don't wanna meet with a Medicare agent in four days from now. I'm here now to get this done and I don't wanna wait. And so I think it's a combination of everything that you said, Kara, but I, you know, those are like the, the bigger buckets that I would say are, are the pain points. The feedback that I have received from multiple brokers now is you need a phone number for the Medicare population. They know how to use a cell phone. They know how to call somebody. That is what they're comfortable doing. Push like multiple people at Elco told us we don't have laptops. So like we set up phone, literally Megan is a fricking rockstar on product. She sat down and downloaded Google Meet on somebody's cell phone so that they could meet with the advisor in four days from when we met with them. But I don't think anything's gonna come from that. Like they're, they're not able to enter anything onto their phone. They're not, they're confused on how to do that. So I think a phone number is how you solve it for this population. Yeah. \nKara Kubarych:\nAnd super resonant. \nZach Egan:\nYeah. And we are between this group, we are going to have a phone number next year and it is in the works. Amazing. We're not talking about it or like making promises now 'cause that timeline's very TPD, but that's the top priority for Gary and it's for this exact reason amongst many of the reasons. Do I think it'll like solve all of these problems? No, but it'll give them someone who can perhaps direct them on how to do it. I think the most challenging thing that development I've seen as of late is like my personal understanding of how we support the Medicare front was just not correct. Like I, since I began spoke to our prospects saying, Hey, we help folks enroll in parts A MB, we do not, we can help with like part D and supplementals, but it is on the onus is on the individual. And I think the, the biggest pushback I've heard is like for for brokers, some of them are equipped to do this, some feel like it shouldn't be their job. But even for that individual to like, okay, now how do I go to the social security office? Like any guidance that we can provide would be helpful. So what we are working on, I met with the Medicare team. We're gonna have, they're working on a one pager right now that we're gonna send in every single sales cycle. If it's a, a post, you know, follow up email and it's like, hey, you must read this or this is important at the, at the end of the day, those doesn't fix everything. We can say like, hey, we can point back to a piece of paper that said we told you how it was gonna work. Right. So some of it isn't like a thatch problem as much as like, you know, the onus is on them as well to do some education. So we're gonna get better during the sales cycle. But that starts with us fully understanding how we support on that front, which is like honestly been a moving target over the past couple months. So I'll keep working with that team and, and we're gonna have something early January. We can start shipping out there. \nRetsy Holliday:\nDennis, is that true? \nKara Kubarych:\nYeah, because it's, I think It's, yeah, go ahead. \nDenis Kalamar:\nYeah, so it's actually not e like not illegal for 65 and above. You can actually still enroll into an a CA plan if you're 65 and older. It's just gonna be more, it's gonna be cheaper if you go to the Medicare route and it's gonna be better benefits. But this is something that Julia and I are seeing for 3G is because the Medicare rep actually kind of screwed up the timing and they're not gonna actually be enrolled into the Medicare plan until the end of January or further. And so in the meantime, he actually enrolled into an a CA plan and he is like 67 and he is doing that for the seven Medicare folks. Oh, interesting. \nRetsy Holliday:\nAs like a stop gap. So like they're actually going to like healthcare.gov planning up for a plan there. They'll reimburse that in the interim until the Medicare plan comes onto the platform and then they can switch it. Are they, is that Exactly, Yeah. Is do you need a qualifying life event to be able to switch from the ac like the on exchange plan to this Medicare plan Or No. \nDenis Kalamar:\nSo that's what we're trying to figure out right now. The hub Medicare person, like actually enrolled it and he said it should be fine, but, but the issue is, is that if you're enrolled in an a CA plan, like you're in the Medicare enrollment process and then you sign up for an a CA plan that's not legally compliant. But if you don't start the enrollment process, then you can sign up for the a CA plan. Oh, interesting. But don't they need to get their applications in now in order to, It's only six months w within the timeframe of when they're Medicare eligible six, six months previously and six months post. Okay. \nRetsy Holliday:\nHmm. \nDenis Kalamar:\nSo that's why like I think that just the guidance on kind of what we're saying as sales reps needs to align with kind of like Yeah, because we've been getting called out a few times from Medicare, a hundred percent specific reps. Yeah, Yeah, no doubt. \nRetsy Holliday:\nSo You're saying my 95-year-old is not gonna be able, this wouldn't work for my 95-year-old since he's been eligible for Medicare for 30 years. \nDenis Kalamar:\nHonestly, like I don't have full like confidence in anything Medicare. Okay. This is like, I'm just like going around the channel. It's like, but I do know 65 and above you can go to the AC marketplace. You don't have to enroll into Medicare if you don't wanna. Okay. \nRetsy Holliday:\nAll right. Good to know. \nKara Kubarych:\nAnd also just share, this isn't, this doesn't answer all the questions and definitely a lot more to discuss, but this support page has been updated with some of the FAQs we've been getting during OEP. So some of these questions are in there. I wouldn't say the answers are all like spot on or like, like fully helpful yet, but this is worth taking a scan through and then Yeah, I know, so Lauren, Jeremy and Hillary joined our CS t meeting or we did like a little one-off training with 'em last week and there was like so much more we didn't even get to, but I know the IMS got a little bit more clarity there. So feel free to collab on that topic as well in the near term. Okay, cool. \nZach Egan:\nAnd yeah, we're gonna do a, a training with that. Team's gonna need a training and we'll have the updated like customer facing docs in, in early Jan is the plan. So that'll be comfortable. We'll need to align on and figure out because I think everyone thinks about it a little bit differently. All right. Pipeline a little bit lighter one today. 'cause we're only focused on two ones. There's a lot in here that is like three ones and ones. We're only gonna focus on two ones. So let's start with the only one in due diligence. Resy with tiro. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah. So this one is the one that Caitlyn and I have been working for a while now. He went to Amsterdam to meet with the co-founders and was like, Hey, we're not making decisions fast enough, but we are still excited about that. So we're checking in with him this week feeling decent about it. Thi this is a group who's not offering benefits today. So it's just a question of like, are they willing to pull the trigger for two one or are they gonna continue to drag their feet? They came to us because they wanna offer benefits to retain, attract talent. Like that is their goal. Mm. So strategically that hasn't changed. It's just a matter of whether or not they wanna fork up, you know, money for this right now or if it ends up happening later in the year. Yeah. \nZach Egan:\nOkay. And I think given two ones like important more so for us than for them, I, I think we'd be more, you could proactively be like, hey, like, and, and you could even do like the classic sales type conversation where it's like, you know, hey, our end of year is Q1 and we're, we're incentivized as sellers to bring on as much business as possible. So with that being said, like we're willing to, you know, discount X percent if you're willing to move now versus mid-year. \nRetsy Holliday:\nAnd we could make that, like we've Already, we've already matched their ventor pepm, so we're at a $20 PEPM right now with them. \nZach Egan:\nAnd No, no broker. No broker. Yeah. I mean go Lower. I if we, if we need to, I think if we, we would be, yeah, we'd be willing to go as low as we possibly can. Okay. To make this a two one versus a three one. Okay. For sure. Cool. \nRetsy Holliday:\nSo I will talk to Michael this week. Cool. \nZach Egan:\nAll right. And then next Sy, KMC wraps, auto home life are all in. There's two ones. Yep. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYep. KMC is a split off of Lazboy. It's all of the non Lazboy branded furniture. They're starting their own business. And so Caitlin and I have done the cost analysis with the founders. They're great guys. They're super interested in that and very lovely to chat with. I will say our quote, like we did every variation dynamic, Mac, Mac flat cost, and we are still coming in like 200, $300,000 more than what they were expecting to spend. But they're also getting the same quotes from group. And so it sounds like we're, we're in the, definitely in the running, but we have not, I I don't know. We presented the quote on like Thursday of last week. So we told them to go play around with it. They are, they are gonna do carve out. So they have hourly part-time and then they have incentive based sellers. So we've done different quotes for each group and we're working through the process with them of evaluating each quote. So we shall See. \nZach Egan:\nAnd and the, the renewal is two one, They're not, they don't need a, sorry. \nRetsy Holliday:\nThey're creating like a new business and so Oh, I see the business. I see. Yeah, they're like an, there is no renewal. They're vir technically a virgin group, but they are coming from from Lazboy. Okay. \nZach Egan:\nAnd and in comparison to the like La-Z-Boy census or numbers were 200 K more expensive. \nRetsy Holliday:\nWe're actually more like three to 400 K. Okay. But they said that that is what they've been getting quoted in the group space. So they said that they had one quote that was much lower than us, but the quality of benefits was much worse. So I'm gonna be real, the numbers don't look great for them and honestly the employee experience is not great either. Like when we did our disruption employee net, like our actual analysis doing a silver one or a silver 25 for some of these groups was not, employees were not in a great spot. And so we explained that to them and they get to decide whether or not they wanna increase their budget or if they're okay with that. But they did say they are using benefits as a way to retain the talent that they are taking away from La-Z-Boy. Gotcha. \nZach Egan:\nOkay. And they're on their own internal payroll system? \nRetsy Holliday:\nYes, they have their own in-house. All right. \nZach Egan:\nYeah, We won't, we won't get our hopes up, but we'll keep it close. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, I'm gonna check in with them this week. They're really genuine and kind and like I know that they'll be real with us on whether or not this is realistic. Yeah. \nZach Egan:\nOkay, next one on here is wraps. \nRetsy Holliday:\nSo met with them. This is the, there's 85 Medicare eligible employees. This is the one I called you about Zach. Yeah. \nZach Egan:\nYeah. \nRetsy Holliday:\nSo yeah, we pushed them to a two one because obviously they called us last week and wanted to do a one one and we said no. And they're very interested and very intrigued. The numbers for group, the average of this group is like 59 years old. It's, yeah, it's an interesting cohort of employees. They, but that being said, the quote is actually very competitive. They're super interested, they are concerned about the Medicare experience. I'm gonna be very transparent. They're like, wait, what are they gonna have to do? How are these employees going to go through that workflow? But I am pinging, I back channeled the Paychex rep and told her that realistically we would like a decision by the end of this week, early next week if we want a successful two one with this group. Yeah. \nZach Egan:\nSo, and okay. And then knowing what we know about Medicare or like kind of know at this point I, I want to talk to Jeremy and just be like, what other questions do we need to ask? Because like if we're gonna support the 85, I just, I mean we can foresee it now. Like we'll get them in there and then there'll be like, some question will come our way of like, Hey, are they all, you know, do they already go through social security process or whatever it is. So yeah, we'll just get, I'll make a note just to like get ahead of the Medicare piece and like actually work for that team to formalize a plan. Cool. \nRetsy Holliday:\nIf it, it makes everybody feel a little bit better. He did, the owner did say he thinks about 10 of the 85 would actually enroll and he is like the rest of them would, would unlikely enroll. So you know that obviously that 10 is a digestible number, 85 is not. And so I am, I'm not as concerned after our second call when he said he thinks only 10 would actually enroll. Okay. \nZach Egan:\nPerfect. That's super nice. All right Andy, we can do to support there. Otherwise your last one on here. Yeah. \nRetsy Holliday:\nHome life or Yes, there it is. Yeah. Home life USI referral had a lovely call with the decision makers last week. She was emailing me over the weekend asking me for like how do I see PLA SBCs and asking for the quote again on a different monitor. So they're definitely playing around with it. They're very intrigued. The U-S-I-U-S-I team feels like this is their only option. The home lifes team only option that would make sense for them next year. And I am, I've sent a note to the USI brokers today a asking for whether or not they think it's realistic for us to have a decision by end of week as well. So feeling decent about that one, probably outta the three that is the, the highest likelihood here of moving forward. Okay. \nZach Egan:\nSweet. Anything the CPM team can do on the USI front? Sounds like they're like fully bought in and They're great. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, we have a great relationship with Casey and, and Chris and they're definitely advocating for us. They're actually side baring us and asking questions about thatch as well. So they're super engaged and we're, we're feeling like a, a good co-selling team right now. \nZach Egan:\nCool. Kara Kay. Do we, I know we sent out, is Kara still here? Maybe not, maybe Doing something. \nJulia Korzeniowski:\nOkay. All good. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nWe're on mute but she might be here. Okay. \nZach Egan:\nIf you're there or Julia, you might be able to help. I know we sent like a lot of gifts to brokers. I don't think it was current clients, it was just brokers recently. Like we had the gift box. Is that like, can we do those as one-offs or was that like a mass shipment through Allie and her team that we weren't involved in? \nJulia Korzeniowski:\nWe did a, a mass send, but I do know that your team, we can, we, we can do and we can send one Chad, we can send one off and created a channel this week and Chad is in it clearly asking if there were any one-offs. She also said she had a few extra gifts laying around. \nZach Egan:\nSo Shall we rip one to this USI crew team? Do we have it? That's great. \nChad Schneider:\nOkay. \nZach Egan:\nTo do that. There's a workflow it sounds like Jules and Chad. \nChad Schneider:\nYeah, rusty, just send me the, the info for the guy. I'll Get it in there. Cool. \nZach Egan:\nPerfect. \nRetsy Holliday:\nThanks Chad. \nChad Schneider:\nYou Got it. Nice. \nZach Egan:\nAll right. And then Tom, this is the midyear one. Mine's midyear. We're looking light on two ones, which means we cleaned it up, which is good. Dennis, oh, LFC meeting last week was, was good. What, what, what do next steps look like here? \nDenis Kalamar:\nI have a meeting with them for the middle of January to kind of evaluate it with their broker. They're not in a huge rush for a two one, but I do think that for a three one this could be a potential as well. Okay. \nZach Egan:\nSo we're meeting in mid-January is the next call. Yeah. So let's, I'm just gonna move it out just given like if we meet, even if we get like the verbal on January 15th click, we would've already need to start enrollment for two one. Right, exactly. \nDenis Kalamar:\nAnd so that's why that's, I like a lot of these like larger ones where it's either self-funded groups, it's just not realistic to try and get a commitment at the beginning and especially 'cause they have I think 25 Medicare, Medicare eligible employees in New York. Yeah. \nZach Egan:\nOkay. We'll, we'll table it for now then any, that kinda sums up the two ones. So we just have a handful in flight. Anything else from the team that's relevant for a two one? We're looking tight on pipeline folks. All right. Well I think it's expected, like there's, this happened last year too. I can probably count on one hand like how many two ones were actually in play for mid-market. So with that being said, like this LFC one, Dennis, anything that's a three one or early next year, like that's just where our energy is gonna need to pivot. Like it's very unlikely we can pull these up unless we can somehow incentivize if we're moving our pum down to, you know, 10 by not for LLC specifically, Dennis, I mean like any other ones around that three, one timeframe, four ones where it's like, hey, if you lock in now we can get you like a $10 pum. Things like that. Very open and willing to do that. But like obviously this is a interesting space where we not like traditional software where you can make that move anytime you want. So yeah, we'll keep doing what we can for these couple of two ones. That'll be the focus and everything else we're on to early next year. Any questions, comments, concerns from the squad, The Providence network? \nDenis Kalamar:\nIs that going to be updated within the new quoting tool? Corey said potentially by the end of the month, do we have like a, a little bit more of a solid timeline for that? \nZach Egan:\nI do not know. I can check with, you're asking if the new, the quoting tool will have those updates? Yeah, honestly it should. But let me, lemme make a note to ping Cory about that. Okay. \nDenis Kalamar:\nI have a couple opportunities specifically like in the Tahoe, El Dorado and Nevada area that the Providence network expansion would make a huge difference. \nZach Egan:\nAnd they, for, for next year I take it? \nDenis Kalamar:\nYeah, well one of them if were a two one, I just don't think realistically it makes sense with them until we get like those numbers to even kind of formulate even proposing a two one transition. But I do think maybe a mid-year, this is for Edgewood, Edgewood companies. Okay. \nZach Egan:\nI think if, let's, let's act like it's live. I'll get more intel to make sure like we'll be available by two one, but even if it doesn't like populate in the tool, if we're still hinting out like, hey, by the time they enroll they're also gonna have Providence. That could be enough. But let me get more clarification from Corey before we go too deep there. \nDenis Kalamar:\nAlright, Sounds good. All right. \nZach Egan:\nAnything else Team, Jess? \nTom Hemmingsen:\nDoes, does anyone have deals for like 4, 1, 5, 1, maybe just four one that are like tracking well that we could book in January? \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, I got one. I'm pushing hard on LJ Rogers and offering 2025 pricing to try to get that done even though I'm kind of, you know, not sure what 2026 pricing looks like, but I'm offering 2025 pricing. But it's good. It's 210, 110 enrolled or 108 enrolled. It's a trucking company based out of North Carolina. So we, Caitlyn and I spent an hour with them. We've done the initial pitch and then Caitlyn and I spent an hour with them last week to do their like full employee disruption analysis. So it went really well. They were excited. No, I I made that up Dennis. It fails. So they were very excited about the employee disruption analysis and then Danielle called me yesterday and said that she's doing another meeting with them on it and this week or early next week. So I'm pushing hard to get them to sign. I said you just need to sign the contract by two one and get preferred pricing That that number is around. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nNice. Love it. Yeah, I mean even though fiscal, you know, fiscal ends two one just for the team, like any bookings, you know before two one is obviously things that will improve our, our fiscal year. So hopefully we get some, get some more of these in the coming coming weeks as well. \nRetsy Holliday:\nTom, that was one question for me was like if we book it, we get the contract signed by two one, but then enrollment's four one, do those enrolled lives count for 2025 enrolled lives or for 2026? \nTom Hemmingsen:\n2026. But in terms of like, you know, our, our business, especially next year as we continue to move up market like bookings are gonna become more and more important. Right. Okay. So like Q1 of next year, we're obviously want to get a lot of enrollments based off whatever our numbers are, but the more bookings we can le level on top of that is, is beneficial too. So, so yeah, it's always like top actually enrolled as best. That's real revenue. Yeah, but you know, we've, we've shown that also like when people sign contracts with us, like for the most part our hit rate is very strong on those. So, but yeah, it'd be, it'd be just like something we could tell, you know, investors and the board and stuff. Cool. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nI ask a question, it's a little random if we have spare time, Go for it. So for some deals or like land and expand, have we considered how the AEs will be involved? Like Resy and I just got off of this deal that has one person in New Mexico, so they're coming to us for a carve out, but it would be beneficial for her to remain involved since she already has all of the context. And right now the two way our team is structured is that CS should be owning that, but really it's a little outside of their scope. 'cause as far as I know, and feel free to correct me if this is changing, there is no real incentive for upsells. So are we considering that as we're going forward and growing as a business? \nTom Hemmingsen:\nSort of like what the structure, so Yes, absolutely. \nZach Egan:\nAnd we've like hinted the idea of like an potential like account management team that owns renewals and upsells and that's like their sole purpose, which has been like how I've seen it in traditional SaaS in the past. It is still very up in the air. I, I think right now the goal is to get sales reps out of the sales cycle so they can focus on the next new business. But in this case, like I had a group called in beta that wanted to do a Texas carve out with like five people, but they were 250. And it's like, as a sales rep, I selfishly also want to be involved in that. So I think as those come up now and with no structure in place, let's just take 'em as one-offs. Like honestly, like res if, if you want to be involved post-sale on that one, like I would just say let's partner with, you know, Julia and Karen, the CS team to make sure we're all like lockstep on this. Or like if you come to periodic check-ins to help out how you can. Awesome. But cool. We also, we just gotta get on the same page with the, the teams. But for now, current state, I'm, I'm all for it if it's gonna lead to expansion. Thanks. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nThat makes sense. And I wouldn't be surprised if that's the way some of the larger groups also approach at grudge is knowing that it's a change For sure. \nZach Egan:\nI think, yeah, we'll see what future that looks like too. And like the enterprise space, like, you know, if you're holding onto just a handful of accounts and folks on upsells, like there's right, right now, like the main way that we upsell is increased enrollment, right? And there's also like potential changes in the future with the marketplace. But yeah, it, it's a very, it's in the adolescent stages of any kind of plan. So we'll just do it as a one-off for now. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nThank you. \nZach Egan:\nAll right, squad, anything else? See you out there. Thank you. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nThanks guys. \n",

The question template appears misaligned with the actual conversation content. Below are comprehensive account notes from the actual discussion:\n\nMEETING OVERVIEW\nMeeting Type: MM Pipeline Review  \nDate: Tuesday, December 16, 2025  \nParticipants: Zach Egan (leader), Kara Kubarych, Retsy Holliday, Denis Kalamar, Tom Hemmingsen, Andrew Solomon, Kaitlin Zidar, Julia Korzeniowski, Chad Schneider, Patricia Gorla, Donny Ho\n\nKEY DISCUSSION TOPICS\n\n1. ENROLLMENT PERFORMANCE (12/15 Mid-Market Groups)\n- Outstanding Performance: Over 300k ARR booked from enrolled members on 12/15\n- Notable Successes:\n  - Metasource: 60 enrolled → 260 enrolled\n  - Napalm: 600 → ~1,200 enrolled\n  - Elko: Over 100% of expected enrollment\n  - Arc, 3G (92% after significant increase)\n- Deadline Extension: 12/19 is the new deadline for most groups\n- Expected Enrollment Metric: Identified as most powerful tracking tool; team needs to continue updating this field in Salesforce\n\n2. MEDICARE WORKFLOW CHALLENGES (Critical Issue Identified)\nProblem Statement: Current Medicare enrollment process is insufficient for the Medicare-eligible population\n\nSpecific Issues Identified:\n- Tech literacy barriers for 65+ population\n- Employees unable to navigate account creation, Google forms, or scheduling\n- Lack of immediate support (4-day wait for advisor meetings unacceptable)\n- Confusion about Medicare Parts A, B, D enrollment responsibilities\n- Employees expecting in-person or phone support\n\nCase Study - Len Stoller Group:\n- 177 enrolled (vs. 140 expected) - excellent enrollment\n- 95-year-old owner and 68-year-old son need Medicare transition support\n- Broker (Andy) requires significant handholding\n- Jeremy's calendar provided for direct Medicare consultation\n\nCase Study - Elko:\n- Employee literally said \"I don't know how to do that\" about opening a computer\n- Many employees don't have laptops, only cell phones\n- Product team (Megan) had to download Google Meet on phones for advisor meetings\n\nProposed Solutions:\n- Phone number for Medicare population (top priority for Gary, timeline TBD for 2026)\n- One-pager documentation for sales cycle (Medicare team working on this for early January 2026)\n- Better sales cycle education about Medicare requirements\n- Clarification: Thatch helps with Part D and supplementals, NOT Parts A & B enrollment\n\nImportant Clarification: 65+ individuals CAN enroll in ACA plans (not illegal), though Medicare is typically cheaper with better benefits.

Mine doesn't add on these internal ones anymore. \nZach Egan:\nYeah, we have someone crashing the party. \nAndrew Solomon:\nDonnie? \nZach Egan:\nDude, you got some lights in that room or no? \nDonny Ho:\nNo, that's a sick day today. So, oh, no, not not trying to overstimulate myself. \nZach Egan:\nDamn dude, I hope you can take it easy. Yeah, Zach, you want, you think? \nAndrew Solomon:\nI think I know what it is. Uh, on this invite and Julia's AoL.com email is on it. So I think it's recognizing it as there's an external somebody on the call. \nZach Egan:\nI see, I mean, I don't know. I think the most surprising thing is Julia has an AOL account. Exactly. \nAndrew Solomon:\nThere's a rare old school, do you know what up? \nDenis Kalamar:\nNothing much. I have a construction outside the door today, so I don't know how long that's gonna go for San Francisco. \nZach Egan:\nWhere'd you get that hat? This one? \nDenis Kalamar:\nYeah, it's, uh, it was in the box they sent us a couple couple months ago. \nZach Egan:\nCool, must have been nice. \nAndrew Solomon:\nYeah, it was for new hire. Zach, it was just a couple months late, so I don't think you made the cut. \nZach Egan:\nI see, I see, I missed out on a lot of swag. Extras. \nPatricia Gorla:\nNo, this is the extras are in the meeting room, actually right below. Inspire Optimism meeting room right below the TV snag one in San Francisco, isn't it? \nZach Egan:\nThat's a different one. He's got that. It's like a relaxed fit. \nAndrew Solomon:\nOh, there's more. \nZach Egan:\nSend them our way, Zach. I'm in office so I could figure it out pretty quick. I'll give it a peek. All right, team. Happy Tuesday. I didn't realize there's a product offsite in office. So it's. Myself and, uh, the whole product team somewhere over here. But I wasn't allowed to have the breakfast tacos that were in the kitchen today, I wasn't, it was product only. So no, they, well, I'm not. But then then, uh, Adler was like, All right, Jack, go ahead, so I guess you can, I? I felt I felt guilty, but I did eat like three of them, so that's probably why they knew that was coming. Yeah, this guy can do some damage. All right, squad. A little pipeline review action. First and foremost, has everyone updated their 2-1s? Her's the request last week. Is 2-1s feeling squeaky clean? If not, it's okay. But speak up or forever hold your peace, because we need these. I got a ping from Gary this morning that we need these done. Everyone's good, it's all good. Yeah, Kara, how you doing? \nKara Kubarych:\nI'm good. I'm like, just starting to pick my head up and think about what's in the pipeline for next year. \nZach Egan:\nSo yeah, that's exciting. \nKara Kubarych:\nAlso, huge kudos, everyone. I feel like we landed in a really good spot as of last night on all the 1215 mid-market groups. So, yeah, good stuff. \nZach Egan:\nWell, and kudos to your team, Kara, because I think last night we had like over 300k in ARR from like booked members just from last night, which is unreal. But if you all haven't seen it, like if you check in on your ops and... Kind of how they progressed, like I had Metasource had 60 enrolled last week, they ended at 260. Like, super impressive. Napalm was at like 600 for a while, they ended, or are close to 1200 at this point. Um, so the push has been huge. \nKara Kubarych:\nYeah, and we've had one other quick note there, exactly, we've had very few at this point. We're going to look through all the data today, tomorrow. Um, that has underperformed the expected enrolled significantly, like using 80 as a threshold. Almost all of the mid markets have been at or above, in some cases far above, which is pretty stellar. Um, and of course, there are lots of factors that drive that, um, so so that I think, you know, that's really exciting. There are still a few that we want to keep pushing through the end of this week. So 12 19 is the deadline extension. I think everybody knows that almost everybody got extended. We don't expect there will be like a ton of movement, though. Um, and Yeah, I was just going to say, I think there was a lot of last minute changes or like improvements, which is also just like power of procrastination, which is pretty wild. But yeah, people have like questions or anything you want to flag to me about groups that you are at all concerned about. Please, please do. But again, I think the communication has been really good and appreciate y'all working really closely with implementation managers through this process. Yeah. \nZach Egan:\nThank you, Carol. Maybe we start there. Is there any care that you're seeing that we are, like, tracking well behind on that we should talk about at the top of the call? \nKara Kubarych:\nYeah, let me just look at the latest list here real quick. Oh, what I was going to say, I was like, I know I lost my train of thought on something. Of course, the slack distracted me. We didn't have that expected enrolled number for a few, you know, not that many in the All's cohort. And thank you for kind of queuing it and updating it a few. Weeks ago. I know Zach helped organize that. We've pinged here and there where they've been missing because it's like, not a calculated field, right? So you actually have to add it in Salesforce. So I know a bunch of those have been backfilled. So thank you. But that metric has probably been the most powerful. And I know, like Chris and team have had, Bob definitely eyes on that of like, the expected enrolled versus expected enrolled. So please, please keep filling that out moving forward, it's really helpful. And then if you do have any that are blank, But at this point, I think on this team, we're really good. You know, just continue to add that in because it's been a great stat and we'll build like more scalable reporting around it here. I can share my screen super fast just so people can see this list and then I'll let y'all move on. Let me just filter to the relevant groups real quick. \nZach Egan:\nAnd while you do that, Kara, I just see the spreadsheet in chat. This team has been... Awesome. I think there's only a handful that are still outstanding. Retsi, it looks like you have about 50, but they're all just the separated Eins from the 30 plus Ein group. So we don't worry about that one. \nKara Kubarych:\nElko did really well, by the way. I think over 100. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOver 100 enrolled? \nKara Kubarych:\nOver 100% expected. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOh, yes. Okay. I was like, that's not what I saw this morning, but that, that, there we go. Yes. I was like, Oh my God, I'm excited. Yeah, Zach, I did just so, you know, I don't know if Andrew's on this call, but I asked Andrew. About that one, um, or just about like, could we, um, somehow update the expected based on the enrollment list that we received from the UM? And he was like, I'm gonna try to do that at like, a, I'm not manually gonna go into all. \nZach Egan:\nNo, no, no, like track that. \nRetsy Holliday:\nBut Andrew did say he thought he could do this at like a higher level. So we might get a better, we might get better detail there. \nZach Egan:\nYeah, yeah. No worries. And I pinged him this morning as well. I think worst case scenario, we'll just look at the aggregate number for assumed. And just, you know, I don't know if it's if. We need to dive into each EIN and please do this as a whole. \nKara Kubarych:\nSo I think, no, no action on that. Really quick. I don't know. I think this is up to date. This is what he put together, and I can ping your all's way as an aggregate. I think this is correct. So this has overall enrollment rate, and then it has the all the EINs. I think those are the four. Is there anyone else that's a multi Ein in this team's cohort that we're missing? \nRetsy Holliday:\nNo, those are my two. \nZach Egan:\nThat's, yeah, not that I know of. Cool. \nKara Kubarych:\nSo let me share this because this is actually like a great little thing, he spun up. Go ahead. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYeah, just I just see it right there. The belonging medical group that are like. Partners That's one of mine that has two eins. Yeah, okay, sweet. So yeah, this, I think, is probably better. \nKara Kubarych:\nLike it was just too hard to merge into that sheet, but keep going. \nZach Egan:\nZACH Yeah, that's good, yeah, if we're good here, we can. Just like reps. I can use this, or Andrew can use this to update that you don't need to worry about it. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOkay, thank you. \nZach Egan:\nAnd then the only other ones I saw in here, Uh, Sully, you had a handful, uh, if you can pop into the doc that I put in chat, it's rows 17 through 19. And then an expected enrollment was not like a required field. It's basically, uh, the purpose is, if we think it's going to vary from the assumed enrollment. Like what they had last year, like, let's say they had 100 enrolled last year, but then they like, aggressively slashed their benefits. They're offering like silver one at 70 we think will be a dip. It's it's our best, like crack at what we think it should be. So that way the CS team can go in and be like, a, they're, they're tracking behind. But it's actually in line with what's expected, based on Sully's conversations, right? Maybe we shouldn't push super hard in this group, things like that, that's cool, exactly. \nAndrew Solomon:\nYeah, I had a question on that because I went back. And I just double checked to make sure that they were in salesforce and they weren't. They were in salesforce, but they weren't porting over. So should you want me to show this manually, Adam here? \nZach Egan:\nYeah, if you could. Was it the expected enrollment field that was filled out? I think there's like three different enrollment fields. \nAndrew Solomon:\nYeah, there's like, assumed and then expected. I'd made sure that they were all filled in. Um, so I don't know if they just weren't pulling over, but I'll go in here and double check them and add them. \nZach Egan:\nOkay, I'm looking now and I'm not seeing it as right here. Let me grab the screen share real quick. \nKara Kubarych:\nYeah, and then I think we're looking at something similar, but I'll come back to my list. I was just filtering Andrew's latest because he just dropped this in, like, Uh, I'm looking right here, slowly on the right. \nZach Egan:\nExpected enrollments. Yeah. \nAndrew Solomon:\nI might have called out the one I didn't do. I see. Hey, it's helpful. \nZach Egan:\nNo, thank you. \nAndrew Solomon:\nSeriously. \nZach Egan:\nFor mine, I knocked mine out this morning. I had like a handful that were blank. So, no, it's not a required field. So no worries. \nAndrew Solomon:\nI gotcha. \nZach Egan:\nAll right, team. Kara, anything else you want to chat over? \nKara Kubarych:\nNo, let me hear. Now that I've got this filter down to what I... Have been generally looking at. Let me just pull this up and then I'll let you keep running. I don't think there's anything that will be super surprising on here. Oh, here, the other thing is, let's look at all the ones that are end date of 12-15. You can see this interesting dance that we've all been doing. All right, so I think this should be the right cohort. But yeah, looking in here. So, like Red Sea, I guess we didn't have it for Lund Stoller. Does that sound, right? \nRetsy Holliday:\nExpected enrollment? We did. I manually put this in, too. It was supposed to be 140 and we're at 177. \nKara Kubarych:\nOkay, amazing. Well, we're doing super great for whatever reason. And again, some of this, I think, is just systems wonkiness. And then Zach, perfect game. Did you have that one? \nZach Egan:\nIt should be in there. Expected was like a 130, and they just eclipsed that last night. Amazing. \nKara Kubarych:\nOkay. So minus those, the only one that's a little bit low, but when you add them up, Tom, is the, these two. So I think their total is at like 90 something percent. Um, and I know they were, were tough. So that was huge. Um, Arc ended in a really good spot. Metasource was challenging, and they came up significantly. 3G, Dennis came up to 92, which was a big increase, and they were really low there for a while. Um, and then I think I just pulled out some of. Um, your all of yours, Retzi. I can pull them back. I just was trying to hide those couple. Um, uh, so I don't know now what's going on. All the sphinx and Elko, Yeah, yeah, I think yours are all. Maybe just to let you guys get back to your meeting. Anything you want to shout out or concerned about? Retzi? \nRetsy Holliday:\nNo, no, no, no. I think they're both good. I know Elko's in a good spot. I think Sphinx is like one employee across every location. It's like going to be hard to, we'll see where we shake out. They had 45 previously enrolled out of 400, and they thought that there was going to be an increase in enrollment on thatch. So I think I bumped it up by like 10 e's from previous enrollment. But no, I don't think there's much more we can do there. Okay. \nKara Kubarych:\nAnd I realize there are a couple of 1222s in here. Okay. Well, if, for whatever reason, people want to try to add backfill these couple one more time in Salesforce, go for it. But otherwise, yeah, the numbers are really good and we'll do another push on a handful of these through end of week. So yeah, good stuff. Awesome. \nZach Egan:\nThanks, Kara. And before we jump into it, Retsi, I think we should start with Len Stoller's group, just so everyone's on the same page with the recent Medicare conversations as well. I'll let you give, like the general overview of maybe like the speed bump we're facing. And then we'll kind of game plan as a group on what we could potentially do to help them out. Even though it looks kind of tight. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, I mean the from an enrollment perspective, they've blown it out of the water. We were 140 previously enrolled, we're at 177 as of today, so that's great. I made it very clear, like six times, to the broker, that the owners could not, Len Stoller himself could not participate on the plan. Len Stoller is 95 years old, and then Len Stoller's son, I guess, is like 68 years old. And so they are both going on to Medicare. So it has been pretty, this is a new broker for us. And he is old school and wants, like, a lot of support and a lot of handholding. And so we've had many calls about how he needs to go support these two guys get on Medicare plans. As a very generous offer, Jeremy gave Shelly, the Medicare agent, to the son, Barry, so that he could get enrolled on Medicare. And now, as of yesterday, the broker is telling me he just realized that. The 95-year-old Len Stoller is on the group plan and hasn't been set up to get onto a Medicare plan yet. So it's just creating. Some, some stress. Um, Andy is just a high anxiety kind of guy and so he brings a lot of that energy into everything that we do. Um, so I gave him Jeremy's personal calendar like Calendly Link today to meet with Jeremy and talk to him. Um, I mean, in this situation like, I think the overall feedback that is relevant for this call is that our Medicare, uh, workflow right now is not sufficient. It's it is not, and we got to witness that on site, for anybody who went on site like it was. You know, you're pushing the population who is the most tech challenged to go use tech. And you would think that, like, you know, scheduling a calendly link isn't that hard, but for that population it is. Um, opening a computer is overwhelming for some of those folks. And so, um, we are working through this now, I think we've been called out rightfully. So by the broker that the Medicare process we have today is not sufficient and does not actually support this population, so we are working through this. But I think the S-Corp owners and needing Medicare support from them is more of like, I put this a little bit on the broker. Like, the broker needs to own this. But we are doing our best to also support him because he is just a very, he's an anxious dude. And he really is looking to us to guide him through this process because it's his first ICRA. \nZach Egan:\nDid the call get scheduled with Jeremy today? \nRetsy Holliday:\nI haven't heard back yet. I sent him the calendly link and have not gotten a response yet. So it might just resolve itself. That's my hope. Is that Andy and I don't talk today? That's not going to happen. Yeah, probably not. No, we're like, around. We're averaging five times a day right now. So, you know, it is what it is. But I think it's a good, it's a good call out. We have a gap in our business right now. Medicare is not our Medicare. Medicare workflow is not sufficient for that population right now. \nZach Egan:\nYeah. And I think. \nKara Kubarych:\nCan I ask you a quick question? Is it, Retsi, and I totally hear you, lots of issues with Medicare, escalations, all sorts of things. Do you think it's largely around the product and people not knowing how to make an account and, like, go through the form and schedule with an advisor? Or is it the advisor availability? Or is it that we're giving like misinformation or lack of information on what is required for Medicare enrollment? Like, do you have a sense of, like, what the biggest buckets are? \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, I mean, I think that you nailed them. I think number one is actually number one is that like people who come like, we had somebody come in, in person at Elko, who has chosen to be on group and not on Medicare. And when we told her, that was no longer an option. She was furious. She literally got very angry and walked out on us. And so I think, like one, this is not a thatch thing. This is an icra thing. When you go onto an ICRA, you have to, if you are Medicare eligible, you have to go on Medicare. And so I actually think it's probably something in the sales cycle that we all need to be doing a little bit more education and talking about more upfront. Hey guys, your Medicare eligible employees have to go on to thatch. It's not an option. Also what the, and we talk a lot about, like allowances and what that means from an allowance perspective and turning QME on and off. But we don't talk about, like, this is what it's going to look like for those employees. Here is a full deck. That like, and I think the CS team does have those assets that come in during implementation, but it needs to be more upfront. It needs to be shared earlier on in the sales cycle so that it isn't such a surprise, especially if they have a large Medicare population. And then I really like, I think at the end of the day, the workflow itself, Kara, like when you go in and first, yes, creating an account, Like, we had one woman at Elko literally sit down and point to the computer and say, I don't know how to do that. And she's literally talking about opening a computer. Like, it is very overwhelming for this population to have to find something in their email, click on that link, go create their account. And then from there, the two options, the workflow options are. Enter your information into this Google form. That's hard. Like, I sat next to somebody and walked her through how to do that. And she had her Social Security page with her right there in that moment and, like, had all of the information she needed. She still didn't feel comfortable doing this by herself. And then I think, when you bring, if you need to go shopping for a plan, The fact that, like, we were on site and then we were like, oh, you're going to meet with a Medicare agent in four days from now. They were like, no, I don't want to meet with a Medicare agent in four days from now. I'm here now to get this done. And I don't want to wait. And so I think it's a combination of everything that you said, Kara. But I, you know, those are like the bigger buckets that, I would say, are the pain points. The feedback that I have received from multiple brokers now is you need a phone number for the Medicare population. They know how to use a cell phone. They know how to call somebody. That is what they are comfortable doing. Push like multiple people at Elko told us, we don't have laptops. So like, we set up phone. Literally, Megan is a freaking rock star on product. She sat down and downloaded Google Meet on somebody's cell phone so that they could meet with the advisor in four days from when we met with them. But I don't think anything's going to come from that. Like, they're not able to enter anything onto their phone. They're not, they're confused on how to do that. So I think a phone number is how you solve it for this population. \nKara Kubarych:\nYeah. \nZach Egan:\nYeah. And we are, between this group, we are going to have a phone number next year and it is in the works. We're not. Talking about it, or like, making promises now, because that timeline is very TBD. But that's the top priority for Gary, and it's for this exact reason, amongst many other reasons. Do I think it'll, like, solve all of these problems? no, but it'll give them someone who can perhaps direct them on how to do it. Um, I think the most challenging thing. That development I've seen as of late is like, my personal understanding of how we support in the Medicare front was just not correct. Like I since that began. I spoke to our prospects, saying, hey, we help folks enroll in parts A and B. We do not. We can help with, like part D and supplementals, but it is on the onus, is on the individual. And I think the biggest pushback I've heard is like, for brokers, some of them are equipped to do this. Some feel like it shouldn't be their job. But even for that individual to like, OK, now, how do I go to the Social Security office? Like any guidance that we can provide. Would be helpful. So what we are working on, I met with the Medicare team, we're going to have, they're working on a one pager right now that we're going to send in every single sales cycle. If it's a post, you know, follow up email and it's like, Hey, you must read this, or this is important. And then, at the end of the day, those doesn't fix everything. We can say, like, Hey, we can point back to a piece of paper that said, we told you how it was going to work. Right. So some of it isn't like a thatch problem, as much as like, you know, the onus is on them as well to do some education. So. We're going to get better during the sales cycle, but that starts with us fully understanding how we support on that front, which is, like, honestly, been a moving target over the past couple months. So I'll keep working with that team and we're going to have something early in January. We can start shipping out there. \nRetsy Holliday:\nAnd is that true? Yeah, because. \nKara Kubarych:\nYeah. Yeah. \nDenis Kalamar:\nSo it's actually not you like, not illegal for 65 and above. You can actually still enroll into an ACA plan if you're 65 and older. It's just going to be more, it's going to be cheaper if you go to the Medicare route, and it's going to be better benefits. But this is something that Julia and I are seeing for 3G is because the Medicare rep actually kind of screwed up the timing. And they're not going to actually be enrolled into the Medicare plan until the end of January or further. And so in the meantime, he actually enrolled into an ACA plan, and he's like 67, and he's doing that for the seven Medicare folks. Oh, interesting. \nRetsy Holliday:\nAs like a stop gap. So, like, they're actually going to, like healthcare.gov. Signing up for a plan there, they'll reimburse that in the interim until the Medicare plan comes onto the platform, and then they can switch it? Do you need a qualifying life event to be able to switch from the on-exchange plan to this Medicare plan? \nDenis Kalamar:\nSo that's what we're trying to figure out right now. The Hub Medicare person actually enrolled it and he said it should be fine. But. But the issue is is that if you're enrolled in an ACA plan, like you're in the Medicare enrollment process and then you sign up for an ACA plan. That's not legally compliant. But if you don't start the enrollment process, then you can sign up for the ACA plan. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOh, interesting. But don't they need to get their applications in now in order to? \nDenis Kalamar:\nIt's only six months within the time frame of when they're Medicare eligible. So, six months previously and six months post. Okay. So that's why, like. I think that just the guidance on kind of what we're saying as sales reps needs to align with, kind of. like, because we've been getting called out a few times from Medicare reps. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, no doubt. So you're saying my 95 year old is not going to be able, this wouldn't work for my 95 year old. Since he's been eligible for Medicare for 30 years. \nDenis Kalamar:\nHonestly, like, I don't have full confidence in anything. Medicare. This is like, I'm just like going around the channel. It's like, but I do know. 65 and above, you can go to the ACA marketplace. You don't have to enroll into Medicare if you don't want to. \nRetsy Holliday:\nAll right. \nKara Kubarych:\nGood to know. But also just share, this doesn't answer all the questions and definitely a lot more to discuss, But this support page has been updated with some of the FAQs we've been getting during OEP. So some of these questions are in there. I wouldn't say the answers are all spot on or fully helpful yet, but this is worth taking a scan through. And then, yeah, I know so. Lauren, Jeremy and Hillary joined our CST meeting. Or we did like a little one-off training with them last week, and there was like, so much more we didn't even get to. But um, I know that I am got a little bit more clarity there, so feel free to collab, um, on that topic as well in the near term. \nZach Egan:\nOkay, cool, um, and yeah. We're gonna do a train with that team,'s gonna lead a training. And we'll have the updated like customer facing docs in early Jan, is the plan. So that'd be something we all need to align on and figure it out. Cause I think everyone thinks about it a little bit differently. Um, all right. Pipeline a little bit lighter one today. Cause we're only focused on two ones. Um, there's a lot in here that is like three ones and four ones. We're only going to focus on two ones. So let's start with the only one in due diligence, Red Sea with Tiro. \nRetsy Holliday:\nUm, yeah, so this one is the one that Caitlin and I've been working for a while now. He went to Amsterdam to meet with the co founders and was like, Hey, we're not making decisions fast enough, but we are still excited about that. So we're checking in with him this week, feeling decent about it. Um, this is a group who's not offering benefits today. So it's just a question of, like, are they willing to pull the trigger for two one? Or are they going to continue to drag their feet? They came to us because they want to offer benefits to retain and attract talent. Like, that is their goal. So, strategically, that hasn't changed. It's just a matter of whether or not they want to fork up money for this right now, or if it ends up happening later in the year. \nZach Egan:\nYeah. OK. And I think, given 2.1 is, like, important, more so for us than for them, I think you could proactively be like, hey, like. And you could even do like the classic sales type conversation where it's like, you know, hey, our end of year is 2.1. We're incentivized as sellers to bring on as much business as possible. So, with that being said, like, we're willing to, you know, discount x percent if you're willing to move now versus mid year. \nRetsy Holliday:\nAnd we can make that like, you know, we've already matched their venture Peppum. So we're at a $20 peppum right now with them. \nZach Egan:\nAnd no, no broker? \nRetsy Holliday:\nNo broker. \nZach Egan:\nYeah. I mean. \nRetsy Holliday:\nGo lower. \nZach Egan:\nI, if we, if we need to, I think we'd be willing to go as low as we possibly can to make this. A two, one versus a three, one, for sure. Cool. \nRetsy Holliday:\nSo I will talk to Michael this week. \nZach Egan:\nCool. Um, all right. And then, uh, next Resi KMC wraps auto home life are all. There's two ones. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYep, yep, KMC is a, uh, split off of lazy boy, it's all of the non-lazy boy branded furniture. Um, they're starting their own business, and so Caitlyn and I have done the cost analysis with the UM founders. They're great guys, they're super interested in that um, and very lovely to chat with. I will say our quote like we did every variation, dynamic MAC, MAC, flat cost. And we are still coming in like $200,000, $300,000 more than what they were expecting to spend. But they're also getting the same quotes from group. And so it sounds like we're definitely in the running. But we have not, I don't know. We presented the quote on like Thursday of last week. So we told them to go play around with it. They are going to do carve out. So they have hourly, part-time. And then they have incentive-based sellers. Um, so we've done different quotes for each group, um, and we're working through the process with them of evaluating each quote. So we shall see. \nZach Egan:\nThe renewal is two, one. \nRetsy Holliday:\nThey're not, they don't need a um, sorry, they're creating like a new business, and so the business, yeah, they're like, there is no renewal. \nZach Egan:\nThey're technically a virgin group, but they are coming from, um, from Lazy boy, okay, and in comparison to the like lazy boy, census or numbers were 200k more expensive? \nRetsy Holliday:\nWe're actually more like 300 to 400k. But they said that that is what they've been getting quoted in the group space. So they said that they had one quote that was much lower than us, but the quality of benefits was much worse. So I'm going to be real. The numbers don't look great for them. And honestly, the employee experience is not great either. When we did our disruption employee net, our actual analysis, doing a silver one or a silver 25 for some of these groups was not. Employees were not in a great spot. And so we explained that to them. And they get to decide whether or not they want to increase their budget, or if they're okay with that. Um, but they did say they are using benefits as a way to retain the talent that they are taking away from. \nZach Egan:\nLazy Boy Gotcha, Okay? And they're on their own internal payroll system. \nRetsy Holliday:\nUh, yes, they have their own in-house. \nZach Egan:\nYeah, we won't, we won't cut our hopes up, but we'll keep it close. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, I'm going to check in with them this week. They're really genuine and kind. And, like, I know that they'll be real with us, and whether or not this is realistic. Yeah. \nZach Egan:\nOK. Next one on here is RAPS. \nRetsy Holliday:\nSo met with them. This is the there's 85 Medicare eligible employees. This is the one I called you about, Zach. Yeah. \nZach Egan:\nYeah. \nRetsy Holliday:\nSo, yeah, we pushed them to a 2-1 because obviously they called us last week and wanted to do a 1-1 and we said no. And they're very interested and very intrigued. The numbers for a group, the average of this group is like 59 years old. It's, yeah, it's an interesting cohort of employees. But that being said, the quote is actually very competitive. They're super interested. They are concerned about the Medicare experience. I'm going to be very transparent. They're like, wait, what are they going to have to do? How are these employees going to go through that workflow? But I'm pinging, I back channeled the paychecks rep and told her that. Realistically, we would like a decision by the end of this week, early next week if we want a successful 2-1 with this group. \nZach Egan:\nYeah, and okay, and then knowing what we know about Medicare, or like, kind of know at this point. Uh, I I want to talk to Jeremy and just be like, what other questions do we need to ask? Because if we're going to support the 85? Um, I just, I mean, foresee it now. Like, we'll get them in there and then there'll be like, some question will come our way of, like, Hey, are they all, you know? Do they already go through Social security process or whatever it is? So, yeah, um, we'll just get. Uh, I'll make a note just to like, get ahead of the Medicare piece and like, actually work for that team to formalize a plan. \nRetsy Holliday:\nCool if it makes everybody feel a little bit better, he did. The owner did say he thinks about 10 of the 85 would actually enroll, and he's like, the rest of them would unlikely enroll. So... You know, that obviously that 10 is a digestible number. 85 is not. And so I'm not as concerned after our second call when he said he thinks only 10 would actually enroll. \nZach Egan:\nOkay, perfect. That's super nice. All right. Anything we can do to support there? Otherwise, your last one on here. Yep. \nRetsy Holliday:\nHome life. \nZach Egan:\nYes, there it is. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah. Home Life, um, USI Referral had a lovely call with the decision makers last week. She was emailing me over the weekend asking me for like, how do I see SBCs? and, um, asking for the quote again on a different monitor. So they're definitely playing around with it. They're very intrigued. Um, the USI, USI team feels like this is their only option, the Home Life's team, only option that would make sense for them next year. And I am. I've sent a note to the USI brokers today asking for whether or not they think it's realistic for us to have a decision by end of week as well. So feeling decent about that one, probably out of the three, that is the highest likelihood here of moving forward. Okay, sweet. \nZach Egan:\nAnything the CPM team can do on the USI front sounds like they're like fully bought in. They're great. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, we have a great relationship with Casey and Chris, and they're definitely advocating for us. They're actually sidebarring us and asking questions about that as well. So they're super engaged. And we're we're feeling like a good co-selling team right now. \nZach Egan:\nCool. Kara Kay, do we I know we sent out? is Kara still here? Maybe not. \nJulia Korzeniowski:\nMaybe doing something. Okay. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nOn mute, but she might be here. Okay. \nZach Egan:\nIf you're there or Julia, you might be able to help. I know we sent like a lot of gifts to brokers. I don't think it was current clients. It was just brokers recently. Like, we had the gift box. Is that, like, can we do those as one officer? Was that like a mass shipment through Allie and her team that we weren't involved in? \nJulia Korzeniowski:\nWe did a mass send, but I do know that. Your we can do and we can send one, we can send one-offs. And he created a channel this week, and Chad is in it, clearly, um, asking if there were any one-offs. She also said she had a few extra gifts laying around. \nZach Egan:\nSo shall we rip one to this USI crew team? We have it, that'd be great. Okay to do that, there's a workflow. It sounds like Jules and Chad. \nChad Schneider:\nYeah, Rusty, just send me the info for the guy. I'll get it in there. \nRetsy Holliday:\nPerfect. Thanks, Chad. \nChad Schneider:\nGot it. Nice. \nZach Egan:\nAll right. And then, Tom, this is the mid-year one. Mine's mid-year. We're looking light on two ones, which means we cleaned it up, which is good. Dennis, oh, LFC. Meeting last week was. Was good. What was what the next steps look like? Here? \nDenis Kalamar:\nI have a meeting with them for the middle of January to kind of evaluate it with their broker. They're not in a huge rush for a 2-1, but I do think that for a 3-1 this could be potential as well. \nZach Egan:\nOkay, so we're meeting in mid-January is the next call. Yeah, so let's, I'm just gonna move it out. Just given. Like if we meet, even if we get like the verbal on January 15th. Like we would have already need to start enrollment for a 2-1, right, exactly. \nDenis Kalamar:\nAnd so that's, that's like a lot of these, like larger ones, where it's either self funded groups, It's just not realistic to try and get a commitment at the beginning. And especially because they have, I think, 25 Medicare, Medicare eligible employees in New York. \nZach Egan:\nYeah, okay, well, we'll table it for now, then any? That kind of sums up the two ones. So we just have a handful in flight, anything else from the team that's relevant for a 2-1. We're looking tight on pipeline, folks. All right. Well, I think it's expected. This happened last year, too. I can probably count, on one hand, how many 2-1s were actually in play for mid-market. So, with that being said, this LFC1, Dennis, anything that's a 3-1 or early next year. Like, that's just where our energy is going to need to pivot. Like, it's very unlikely we can pull these up unless we can somehow incentivize if we're moving our pep them down to, you know, 10, But not for LLC specifically. Dennis. I mean, like any other ones around that three, one timeframe, four ones, where it's like, Hey, if you lock in now, we can get you like a $10 pep on things like that. Very open and willing to do that. But like, obviously this is an interesting space where we not like traditional software, where you can make that move anytime you want. So. Um, yeah, we'll keep doing what we can for these couple of two ones, that'll be the focus and everything else we're on to early next year. Any questions, comments, concerns from the squad? \nDenis Kalamar:\nThe Providence Network? Is that going to be updated within the new quoting tool, Cory said, potentially by the end of the month. Do we have, like, a little bit more of a solid timeline for that? \nZach Egan:\nI do not know. I can check with. You're asking if the new the quoting tool will have those updates. \nDenis Kalamar:\nYeah. Honestly, it should. \nZach Egan:\nBut let me, let me make a note to pin Corey about that. OK. \nDenis Kalamar:\nI have a couple opportunities specifically, like in the Tahoe, El Dorado and Nevada area, that the Providence network expansion would make a huge. \nZach Egan:\nUm, and therefore for next year, I take it. \nDenis Kalamar:\nYeah, well, one of them have scored two, one. I just don't think realistically it makes sense with them. Until we get like those numbers to even kind of formulate, even proposing a two one uh transition. But I do think maybe a mid-year. This is for Edgewood, um, Edgewood companies. \nZach Egan:\nOkay, I think if let's, let's act like it's live, uh, I'll get more intel to make sure like we'll be available by 2.1, But even if it doesn't like populate in the tool, if we're still hinting out, like, hey, by the time they enroll, they're also going to have providence, that could be enough. But let me get more clarification from Corey before we go too deep there. \nDenis Kalamar:\nAll right. Sounds good. All right. \nZach Egan:\nAnything else, team? \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYes. Does anyone have deals for like 4.1, 5.1? Maybe just for one that are like tracking well that we could book in January? \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, I got one. I'm pushing hard on L.J. Rogers and offering 2025 pricing to try to get that done, even though I'm kind of, you know, not sure what 2026 pricing looks like, but I'm offering 2025 pricing. But it's good. It's 210, 110 enrolled, or 108 enrolled. It's a trucking company based out of North Carolina. So we, Caitlin and I spent an hour with them. We've done the initial pitch and then Caitlin and I spent an hour with them last week to do their like full employee disruption analysis. So it went really well. They were excited. No, I made that up, Ennis. fails. So they were very excited about the employee disruption analysis. And then Danielle called me yesterday and said that. She's doing another meeting with them on it and this week or early next week. So I'm pushing hard to get them to sign. I said, you just need to sign the contract by 2-1 and get preferred pricing. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nNice. Yeah. I mean, even the fiscal, you know, fiscal ends. 2-1 just for the team, like any bookings, you know, before 2-1 is obviously things that will improve our fiscal year. So hopefully we get some more of these in the coming weeks as well. \nRetsy Holliday:\nTom, that was one question for me was like, we book it, we get the contract signed by 2-1, but then enrollments 4-1, Do those enrolled lives count for 2025 enrolled lives or for 2026? \nTom Hemmingsen:\n2026, But in terms of like, you know, our business, especially next year, as we continue to move up market, like bookings, are going to become more and more important, right? So like Q1. Of next year. We're obviously want to get a lot of enrollments based off whatever our numbers are, but the more bookings we can let. Level on top of that is is beneficial too. So um, so, yeah, it's always like, top actually enrolled is best, that's real revenue. But you know, we've, we've shown that also, like when people sign contracts with us, like, for the most part, our hit rate is very strong on those. So, but yeah, it'd be just like something we could tell. You know, investors and the board and stuff. Cool. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nI asked a question. It's a little random. If we have spare time. \nZach Egan:\nGo for it. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nSo for some, deals are like land and expand. Have we considered how the AES will be involved? Like, Betsy and I just got off of this deal that had one person in New Mexico. So there's. Coming to us for a carve out, But it would be beneficial for her to remain involved since she already has all of the context. And right now, the way our team is structured is that CS should be owning that, but really, it's a little outside of their scope, as far as I know. And feel free to correct me if this is changing. There is no real incentive for upsells. So are we considering that as we're going forward and growing as a business? \nZach Egan:\nSo. Yes, absolutely. And we've hinted the idea of a potential account management team that owns renewals and upsells. And that's their sole purpose, which has been how I've seen it in traditional Saas in the past. It is still very up in the air. I think right now the goal is to get sales reps out of the sales cycle so they can focus on the next new business. But in this case, I had a group called Embeda. I wanted to do a Texas carve out with like five people, but they were 250. And it's like, as a sales rep, I selfishly also want to be involved in that. So I think as those come up now and with no structure in place, let's just take them as one-offs. Like, honestly, like Rats, if you want to be involved post-sale on that one, like, I would just say, let's partner with, you know, Julia and Karen, the CS team, to make sure we're all like, lockstep on this. Or, like, if you come to periodic check-ins to help out how you can, awesome. But Well, we also, we just got to get on the same page with the teams. But for now, current state, I'm all for it. If it's going to lead to expansion. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nThanks. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nThat makes sense. And I wouldn't be surprised if that's the way some of the larger groups also approach it, just knowing that it's a change. \nZach Egan:\nFor sure. I think, yeah, we'll see what future that looks like, too. And like the enterprise space, like, you know, if you're holding on to just a handful of accounts and focusing on upsells, like, there's. Right now, the main way that we upsell is increased enrollment. And there's also potential changes in the future with the marketplace. But yeah, it's in the adolescent stages of any kind of plan. So we'll just do it as a one-off for now. Thank you. All right, squad. Anything else? See you out there. Thank you. \nRetsy Holliday:\nThanks, guys. \n",

The notes below reflect the actual content discussed.\n\nACCOUNT NOTES - MM Pipeline Review Meeting\nDate: Tuesday, December 16, 2025\n\nMEETING OVERVIEW\nInternal pipeline review focused on 2/1/2026 opportunities, OEP results for 12/15 mid-market groups, and Medicare enrollment workflow challenges.\n\nKEY DISCUSSION POINTS\n\n1. Open Enrollment Performance (12/15 Groups)\n- Strong overall performance: Over 300k ARR booked from enrolled members on 12/15\n- Notable successes:\n  - Metasource: Grew from 60 to 260 enrolled\n  - Napalm: Grew from ~600 to ~1,200 enrolled\n  - Elko: Exceeded 100% of expected enrollment\n  - Lund Stoller: 177 enrolled vs. 140 expected (127% performance)\n- Most mid-market groups met or exceeded 80% enrollment threshold\n- Deadline extended to 12/19/2025 for final push\n\n2. Critical Medicare Workflow Gaps Identified\n- Major Issue: Current Medicare enrollment process insufficient for Medicare-eligible population\n- Specific Challenges:\n  - Tech literacy barriers for 65+ population\n  - Confusion about Parts A & B enrollment requirements (Thatch does NOT support this)\n  - Lack of phone support (population prefers calling vs. online forms)\n  - 4-day wait time for advisor meetings unacceptable for on-site enrollments\n  - Misinformation about ICHRA Medicare requirements during sales cycle\n- Impact: Broker complaints, employee frustration, operational strain\n\n3. 2/1/2026 Pipeline Status\nLimited 2/1 opportunities in flight:\n\nActive 2/1 Deals:\n- Tiro (Retsy): No current benefits, decision pending this week, $20 PEPM (no broker)\n- KMC Wraps (Retsy): Lazy Boy spin-off, quote $200-400k higher than expected, competitive with group quotes\n- Wraps (Retsy): 85 Medicare-eligible employees (owner estimates only 10 would enroll), decision needed by end of week\n- Home Life (Retsy): USI referral, highest likelihood of closing, decision expected end of week\n\nMid-Year/Later Opportunities:\n- LFC (Denis): Meeting mid-January, likely 3/1 or later due to 25 Medicare-eligible employees in NY\n- L.J. Rogers (Retsy): 110 enrolled, trucking company NC, pushing for 4/1 with 2025 pricing incentive\n\nSTAKEHOLDERS & RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nInternal Thatch Team:\n- Zach Egan: Sales Leader, pipeline management, Medicare strategy coordination\n- Kara Kubarych: CS/Implementation Lead, OEP tracking, enrollment metrics\n- Retsy Holliday: AE managing Tiro, KMC, Wraps, Home Life, L.J. Rogers\n- Denis Kalamar: AE managing LFC, 3G, Edgewood Companies\n- Tom Hemmingsen: AE, bookings focus\n- Kaitlin Zidar: AE, land-and-expand strategy questions\n- Andrew Solomon: Sales Operations, Salesforce data management\n- Jeremy: Medicare team lead\n- Gary: Leadership (requested 2/1 updates)\n- Chad Schneider: Gift/broker relations coordination\n- Julia Korzeniowski: Marketing/broker gifts\n\nExternal Brokers:\n- USI Team (Casey & Chris): Co-selling on Home Life deal\n- Andy: Lund Stoller broker (high-anxiety, requires significant handholding)\n- Paychecks Rep: Wraps opportunity\n\nCRITICAL MILESTONES & TIMESTAMPS\n\nDecember 15, 2025: \n- Original OEP deadline for mid-market groups\n- Strong enrollment results posted (300k+ ARR)\n\nDecember 16, 2025 (Meeting Date):\n- Pipeline review conducted\n- Medicare workflow gaps formally identified\n- 2/1 opportunities assessed\n\nDecember 19, 2025: \n- Extended OEP deadline for final enrollment push\n\nEnd of Week (December 20, 2025):\n- Target decision date for Wraps, Home Life, Tiro\n- Retsy to check in with all active 2/1 prospects\n\nMid-January 2026:\n- LFC meeting scheduled (Denis)\n- Expected timeline for Medicare support documentation\n\nEarly January 2026:\n- Medicare training session planned (led by Medicare team)\n- Updated customer-facing Medicare documentation to be released\n- Phone support for Medicare population (top priority, timeline TBD)\n\nFebruary 1, 2026: \n- Target start date for active pipeline opportunities\n- Fiscal year-end for bookings\n\nNEXT STEPS & DEADLINES\n\nImmediate (By December 20, 2025):\n\n1. Retsy Holliday:\n   - Follow up with Tiro on decision (offer aggressive discount if needed to secure 2/1)\n   - Check in with KMC on quote evaluation\n   - Confirm Wraps decision timeline with Paychecks rep\n   - Coordinate with USI team on Home Life decision\n   - Push L.J. Rogers to sign by 2/1 for 2025 pricing\n\n2. Zach Egan:\n   - Confirm Providence Network expansion timeline with Corey for quoting tool\n   - Coordinate with Jeremy on Medicare support requirements for Wraps (85 Medicare-eligible)\n   - Develop Medicare question framework for sales qualification\n\n3. Chad Schneider:\n   - Send gift to USI broker team (Casey & Chris) for Home Life deal\n\n4. Team-Wide:\n   - Continue final enrollment push through 12/19 deadline\n   - Update expected enrollment fields in Salesforce for any remaining gaps\n\nShort-Term (January 2026):\n\n1. Medicare Team (Jeremy, Lauren, Hillary):\n   - Conduct training session for sales team on Medicare support scope\n   - Finalize one-pager for sales cycle explaining Medicare enrollment process\n   - Update support documentation (already in progress per Kara)\n\n2. Zach Egan:\n   - Distribute Medicare one-pager to all sales reps for prospect communications\n   - Implement requirement to share Medicare documentation in every sales cycle\n\n3. Denis Kalamar:\n   - Mid-January meeting with LFC and broker\n   - Evaluate Edgewood Companies for mid-year opportunity (pending Providence Network expansion)\n\nStrategic Priorities:\n\n1. Phone Support for Medicare Population: Top priority per Gary, timeline TBD\n2. Account Management Structure: Evaluate need for dedicated renewal/upsell team\n3. Medicare Education in Sales Cycle: Implement earlier, more comprehensive education about ICRA Medicare requirements\n4. Pricing Flexibility: Willing to discount aggressively (as low as possible) to convert 2/1 opportunities vs. 3/1 or later\n\nOPERATIONAL NOTES\n\n- Expected Enrollment Field: Critical metric for tracking performance, must be filled out in Salesforce for all groups\n- Bookings vs. Enrollments: Bookings before 2/1 count toward FY2025 even if enrollment is later\n- Land-and-Expand: No formal structure yet; handle as one-offs with CS collaboration\n- 2025 vs. 2026 Pricing: Can offer 2025 pricing as incentive for early commitments\n\nRISKS & CONCERNS\n\n1. Medicare Workflow: Significant gap in service delivery, causing broker complaints and employee dissatisfaction\n2. Limited 2/1 Pipeline: Very few realistic 2/1 opportunities remaining\n3. Large Medicare Populations: Groups with 25+ Medicare-eligible employees present operational challenges\n4. Pricing Competitiveness: Some quotes coming in $200-400k higher than client expectations\n5. Sales Cycle Education: Medicare requirements not adequately communicated upfront, causing surprises during implementation"

            "transcript": "Andrew Solomon:\nSo, dude, sorry bunch of Ais, I don't understand. \nZach Egan:\nUsually that happens when there's like an external, uh, email on the invite. \nAndrew Solomon:\nYeah, right, like mine doesn't add on these internal ones anymore. Yeah, we have someone crushing the party, it's not again. \nZach Egan:\nDonnie, Oh, dude, you got some lights in that room or no? \nDonny Ho:\nNo, that's a sick day today, so no, oh, no, not not trying to over stimulate myself. \nZach Egan:\nDamn dude, I hope you can take it easy. Yeah, Zach, you want, you think? \nAndrew Solomon:\nI think I know what it is. Uh, on this invite and Julia's Aol.com email is on it. So I think it's recognizing it as there's an external somebody on the call. \nZach Egan:\nI see, I mean, I don't know. I think the most surprising thing is Julia has an AOL account. Exactly. It's a rare. \nAndrew Solomon:\nOld school. \nZach Egan:\nDo you know what else? \nDenis Kalamar:\nNothing much. I have a construction outside the door today, so I don't know how long that's going to go for. \nZach Egan:\nSan Francisco. Where'd you get that hat? \nDenis Kalamar:\nThis one? Yeah, it's a it was in the box. They sent us a couple couple months ago. Cool. \nZach Egan:\nIt's been nice. \nAndrew Solomon:\nIt was for new hire, Zach. It was just a couple months late. So I don't think you made the cut. \nZach Egan:\nI see. I see. I missed out on a lot of swag. \nPatricia Gorla:\nExtras. No, this is the extras are in the meeting room, actually right below. Inspire Optimism Meeting room right below. The TV snagged one in San Francisco, isn't it? \nZach Egan:\nThat's a different one he's got, though. It's like a relaxed fit. \nAndrew Solomon:\nThere's more. Send them our way. \nZach Egan:\nI'm in office so I could figure it out pretty quick. I'll give it a peek. All right, team, Happy Tuesday. I didn't realize there's a product off-site in office, so it's myself and, uh, the whole product team somewhere over here. But I wasn't allowed to have the breakfast tacos that were in the kitchen today, I wasn't, it was product only. \nAndrew Solomon:\nSo you're kidding? \nZach Egan:\nNo, they, well, I'm not. But then it was in. The Adler was like, All right, Jack, go ahead, so I guess you can, I. I felt I felt guilty, but I did eat like three of them, so that's probably why they knew that was coming. Yeah, this guy can do some damage. All right, squad. A little pipeline review action. First and foremost, has everyone updated their 2-1s? Heard the request last week. Is 2-1s feeling squeaky clean? If not, it's okay. But speak up or forever hold your peace, because we need these. I got a ping from Gary this morning that we need these done. Everyone's good, it's all good. Yeah, cool Kara, how are you doing? \nKara Kubarych:\nI'm good. I'm like, just starting to pick my head up and think about what's in the pipeline for next year, so it's exciting. Also, huge kudos, everyone. I feel like we landed in a really good spot as of last night on all the 1215 mid-market groups. So, yeah, good stuff. \nZach Egan:\nWell, and kudos to your team, Kara, because I think last night we had like over 300k in ARR from like booked members just from last night, which is unreal. But if you all haven't seen it, like if you check in on your ops and... Kind of how they progressed, like I had Metasource had 60 enrolled last week, they ended at 260. Like, super impressive. Napalm was at like 600 for a while, they ended, or are close to 1200 at this point. Um, so the push has been huge. \nKara Kubarych:\nYeah, and we've had one other quick note there, exactly, we've had very few at this point. We're going to look through all the data today, tomorrow. Um, that has underperformed the expected enrolled significantly, like using 80 as a threshold. Almost all of the mid markets have been at or above, in some cases far above, which is pretty stellar. Um, and of course, there are lots of factors that drive that, um, so so that I think, you know, that's really exciting. There are still a few that we want to keep pushing through the end of this week. So 12 19 is the deadline extension. I think everybody knows that almost everybody got extended. We don't expect there will be like a ton of movement, though. Um, and Yeah, I was just going to say, I think there was a lot of last minute changes or like improvements, which is also just like power of procrastination, which is pretty wild. But yeah, people have like questions or anything you want to flag to me about groups that you are at all concerned about. Please, please do. But again, I think the communication has been really good and appreciate y'all working really closely with implementation managers through this process. Yeah. \nZach Egan:\nThank you, Carol. Maybe we start there. Is there any care that you're seeing that we are, like, tracking well behind on that we should talk about at the top of the call? \nKara Kubarych:\nYeah, let me just look at the latest list here real quick. Oh, what I was going to say, I was like, I know I lost my train of thought on something. Of course, the slack distracted me. We didn't have that expected enrolled number for a few, you know, not that many in the All's cohort. And thank you for kind of queuing it and updating it a few. Weeks ago. I know Zach helped organize that. We've pinged here and there where they've been missing because it's not a calculated field, right? So you actually have to add it in Salesforce. So I know a bunch of those have been backfilled, so thank you. But that metric has probably been the most powerful. And I know Chris and team have had, Bob, definitely eyes on that of the expected enrolled versus expected enrolled. So please, please keep filling that out moving forward. It's really helpful. And then if you do have any that are blank, But at this point, I think on this team, we're really good. You know, just continue to add that in because it's been a great stat and we'll build like more scalable reporting around it here. I can share my screen super fast just so people can see this list and then I'll let y'all move on. We just filter to the relevant groups real quick. \nZach Egan:\nAnd while you do that, Kara, I just see the spreadsheet in chat. This team has been... Awesome. I think there's only a handful that are still outstanding. Retsi, it looks like you have about 50, but they're all just the separated Eins from the 30 plus Ein group. \nRetsy Holliday:\nSo we don't really know about that one. \nKara Kubarych:\nElko did really well, by the way, I think over 100. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOver 100 enrolled? \nKara Kubarych:\nOver 100% expected. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOh, yes. Okay. I was like, that's not what I saw this morning, but that, that, there we go. Yes. I was like, Oh my God, I'm excited. Yeah, Zach, I did just so, you know, I don't know if Andrew's on this call, but I asked Andrew. About that one, um, or just about like, could we, um, somehow update the expected based on the enrollment list that we received from the UM? And he was like, I'm gonna try to do that at like, a, I'm not manually gonna go into all. \nZach Egan:\nNo, no, I like track that. \nRetsy Holliday:\nBut Andrew did say he thought he could do this at like a higher level. So we might get a better, we might get better detail there. \nZach Egan:\nYeah, yeah, no worries. And I I pinged him this morning as well. I think, worst case scenario, we'll just look at the aggregate number, uh, for assumed. And just, you know, I don't know if it is. If we need to dive into each EIN, if we do this as a whole. \nRetsy Holliday:\nSo okay, I think no. \nKara Kubarych:\nNo action on that doc really quick. Um, I don't know. I think this is up to date. This is what he put together and I can ping your all's way. As an aggregate, I think this is correct. So this has overall enrollment rate, and then it has the all the EINs. I think those are the four. Is there anyone else that's a multi Ein in this team's cohort that we're missing? \nRetsy Holliday:\nNo, those are my two. \nZach Egan:\nThat's, yeah, not that I know of. Cool. \nKara Kubarych:\nSo, yeah, let me share this, because this is actually like a great little thing, he spun up. Go ahead. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYeah, just I just see it right there. The belonging medical group that are like. Partners That's one of mine that has two eins. Yeah, okay, sweet. \nKara Kubarych:\nSo yeah, this, I think, is probably better. Like it was just too hard to merge into that sheet, but keep going. \nZach Egan:\nZACH Yeah, that's good. Yeah, if we're good here, we can just like rats. I can use this, or Andrew can use this to update that you don't need to worry about it. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOkay, thank you. \nZach Egan:\nAnd then the only other ones I saw in here, Uh, Sully, you had a handful, uh, if you can pop into the doc that I put in chat, it's rows 17 through 19. And then an expected enrollment was not like a required field. It's basically, uh, the purpose is, if we think it's going to vary from the assumed enrollment. Like what they had last year, let's say they had 100 enrolled last year. But then they, like, aggressively slashed their benefits. They're offering like silver one at 70 we think will be a dip. It's it's our best, like crack at what we think it should be. So that way the CS team can go in and be like they're tracking behind. But it's actually in line with what's expected, based on Sully's conversations, right? Maybe we shouldn't push super hard in this group, things like that, that's cool, exactly. \nAndrew Solomon:\nYeah, I had a question on that. Because I went back. And I just double checked to make sure that they were in salesforce and they weren't. They were in salesforce, but they weren't porting over. So should you want me to show this manually, Adam here? \nZach Egan:\nYeah, if you could, was it the expected enrollment field that was filled out? I think there's like three different enrollment fields. \nAndrew Solomon:\nYeah, there's like, assumed and then expected. I'd made sure that they were all filled in. Um, so I don't know if they just weren't pulling over, but I'll go in here and double check them and add them. \nZach Egan:\nOkay, I'm looking now and I'm not seeing it as right here. Let me grab the screen share real quick. \nKara Kubarych:\nYeah, and then I think we're looking at something similar, but I'll come back to my list. I was just filtering Andrew's latest because he just dropped this in, like, Uh, I'm looking right here. \nZach Egan:\nSully on the right. Expected enrollments. Yeah. \nAndrew Solomon:\nMartin called out the one I didn't do. I see. \nKara Kubarych:\nHey, it's helpful. \nZach Egan:\nNo, thank you. \nAndrew Solomon:\nSeriously. \nZach Egan:\nFor mine, I knocked mine out this morning. I had like a handful that were blank. So, no, it's not a required field. So no worries. \nAndrew Solomon:\nI gotcha. All right, team. \nZach Egan:\nKara, anything else you want to chat over? \nKara Kubarych:\nNo, let me hear. Now that I've got this filter down to what I... Have been generally looking at. Let me just pull this up and then I'll let y'all keep running. I don't think there's anything that will be super surprising on here. Oh, here, the other thing is, let's look at all the ones that are end date of 12-15. You can see this interesting dance that we've all been doing. All right, so I think this should be the right cohort. But yeah, looking in here. So, like Red Sea, I guess we didn't have it for Lund Stoller. Does that sound, right? \nRetsy Holliday:\nExpected enrollment? We did. I manually put this in, too. It was supposed to be 140 and we're at 177. \nKara Kubarych:\nOkay, amazing. Well, we're doing super great for whatever reason. And again, some of this, I think, is just systems wonkiness. And then Zach, perfect game. Did you have that one? \nZach Egan:\nIt should be in there. Expected was like a 130, and they just eclipsed that last night. Amazing. \nKara Kubarych:\nOkay. So minus those, the only one that's a little bit low, but when you add them up, Tom, is these two. So I think their total is at like 90 something percent. And I know they were tough. So that was huge. Arc ended in a really good spot. Metasource was challenging, and they came up significantly. 3G, Dennis came up to 92, which was a big increase, and they were really low there for a while. And then I think I just pulled out some of. Um, your all of yours, Retzi. I can pull them back. I just was trying to hide those couple. Um, uh, so I don't know now what's going on. All the sphinx and Elko, Yeah, yeah, I think yours are all. Maybe just to let you guys get back to your meeting. Anything you want to shout out or concerned about? Retzi? \nRetsy Holliday:\nNo, no, no, no. I think they're both good. I know Elko's in a good spot. I think Sphinx is like one employee across every location. It's like going to be hard to, we'll see where we shake out. They had 45 previously enrolled out of 400, and they thought that there was going to be an increase in enrollment on thatch. So I think I bumped it up by like 10 e's from previous enrollment. But no, I don't think there's much more we can do there. Okay. \nKara Kubarych:\nAnd I realize there are a couple of 1222s in here. Okay. Well, if, for whatever reason, people want to try to add backfill these couple one more time in Salesforce, go for it. But otherwise, yeah, the numbers are really good. And we'll do another push on a handful of these through end of week. So yeah, good stuff. Awesome. \nZach Egan:\nThanks, Kara. And before we jump into it, Retsi, I think we should start with Len Stoller's group, just so everyone's on the same page with the recent. Medicare conversations as well. I'll let you give like the general overview of like the speed bump we're facing. And then we'll kind of game plan as a group on what we could potentially do to help them out, even though it looks kind of tight. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, I mean, from an enrollment perspective, they've blown it out of the water. We were 140 previously enrolled. We're at 177 as of today, so that's great. I made it very clear, like six times, to the broker, that the owners could not, Len Stoller himself could not participate on the plan. Len Stoller is 95 years old, and then Len Stoller's son, I guess, is like 68 years old. And so they are both going on to Medicare. So it has been pretty, this is a new broker for us. And he is old school and wants, like, a lot of support and a lot of handholding. And so we've had many calls about how he needs to go support these two guys get on Medicare plans. His as a very generous offer, Jeremy gave Shelly, the Medicare agent, to the son, Barry, so that he could get enrolled on Medicare. And now, as of yesterday, the broker is telling me he just realized that. The 95 year old Len Stoller is on the group plan and hasn't been set up to be like, get onto a Medicare plan yet. So it's just creating. Some, some stress. Um, Andy is just a high anxiety kind of guy and so he brings a lot of that energy into everything that we do. Um, so I gave him Jeremy's personal calendar like Calendly Link today to meet with Jeremy and talk to him. Um, I mean, in this situation like, I think the overall feedback that is relevant for this call is that our Medicare, uh, workflow right now is not sufficient. It's it is not. And we got to witness that on site, for anybody who went on site like it was. You're pushing the population who is the most tech challenged to go use tech. And you would think that scheduling a calendly link isn't that hard, but for that population, it is. Opening a computer is overwhelming for some of those folks. And so we are working through this now. I think we've been called out, rightfully so, by the broker. That the Medicare process we have today is not sufficient and does not actually support this population. So we are working through this. But I think the S-Corp owners and needing Medicare support from them is more of like, I put this a little bit on the broker. Like, the broker needs to own this. But we are doing our best to also support him because he is just a very, he's an anxious dude. And he really is looking to us to guide him through this process because it's his first ICRA. \nZach Egan:\nDid the call get scheduled with Jeremy today? \nRetsy Holliday:\nI haven't heard back yet. I sent him the calendly link and have not gotten a response yet. So it might just resolve itself. That's my hope. Is that Andy and I don't talk today? That's not going to happen. Yeah, probably not. No, we're like, around, we're averaging five times a day right now. So, you know, it is what it is. But I think it's a good, it's a good call out. We have a gap in our business right now. Medicare is not, our Medicare workflow is not sufficient for that population right now. \nZach Egan:\nYeah. \nKara Kubarych:\nAnd I think. Can I ask you a quick question? Is it, Retsi, and I totally hear you, lots of issues with Medicare, escalations, all sorts of things. Do you think it's largely around the product and people not knowing how to make an account and, like, go through the form and schedule with an advisor? Or is it the advisor availability? Or is it that we're giving like misinformation or lack of information on what is required for Medicare enrollment? Like, do you have a sense of, like, what the biggest buckets are? \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, I mean, I think that you nailed them. I think number one is actually number one is that like people who come like, we had somebody come in, in person at Elko, who has chosen to be on group and not on Medicare. And when we told her, that was no longer an option. She was furious. She literally got very angry and walked out on us. And so I think, like one, this is not a thatch thing. This is an icra thing. When you go onto an ICRA, you have to, if you are Medicare eligible, you have to go on Medicare. And so I actually think it's probably something in the sales cycle that we all need to be doing a little bit more education and talking about more upfront. Hey guys, your Medicare eligible employees have to go on to thatch. It's not an option. Also what the, and we talk a lot about, like allowances and what that means from an allowance perspective and turning QME on and off. But we don't talk about, like, this is what it's going to look like for those employees. Here is a full deck. That like, and I think the CS team does have those assets that come in during implementation, but it needs to be more upfront. It needs to be shared earlier on in the sales cycle so that it isn't such a surprise, especially if they have a large Medicare population. And then I really like, I think at the end of the day, the workflow itself, Kara, like when you go in and first, yes, creating an account, Like, we had one woman at Elko literally sit down and point to the computer and say, I don't know how to do that. And she's literally talking about opening a computer. Like, it is very overwhelming for this population to have to find something in their email, click on that link, go create their account. And then from there, the two options, the workflow options are. Enter this your information into this Google form. That's hard. Like, I sat next to somebody and walked her through how to do that. And she had her Social Security page with her right there in that moment and, like, had all of the information she needed. She still didn't feel comfortable doing this by herself. And then I think, when you bring, if you need to go shopping for a plan, The fact that, like, we were on site and then we were like, oh, you're going to meet with a Medicare agent in four days from now. They were like, no, I don't want to meet with a Medicare agent in four days from now. I'm here now to get this done. And I don't want to wait. And so I think it's a combination of everything that you said, Kara. But I, you know, those are like the bigger buckets that, I would say, are the pain points. The feedback that I have received from multiple brokers now is you need a phone number for the Medicare population. They know how to use a cell phone. They know how to call somebody. That is what they are comfortable doing. Push like multiple people at Elko told us, we don't have laptops. So like, we set up phone. Literally, Megan is a freaking rock star on products. She sat down and downloaded. Google meet on somebody's cell phone so that they could meet with the advisor in four days from when we met with them. But I don't think anything's going to come from that. Like, they're not able to enter anything onto their phone. They're not, they're confused on how to do that. So I think a phone number is how you solve it for this population. \nZach Egan:\nYeah. Yeah. And we are, between this group, we are going to have a phone number next year and it is in the works. We're not. Talking about it, or like, making promises now, because that timeline is very TBD. But that's the top priority for Gary. And it's for this exact reason, amongst many other reasons. Do I think it'll, like, solve all of these problems? no, but it'll give them someone who can perhaps direct them on how to do it. Um, I think the most challenging thing. That development I've seen as of late is like, my personal understanding of how we support in the Medicare front was just not correct. Like I sent that began spoke to our prospects, saying, hey, we help folks enroll in parts A and B. We do not. We can help with part D and supplementals, but the onus is on the individual. And I think the biggest pushback I've heard is for brokers, some of them are equipped to do this. Some feel like it shouldn't be their job. But even for that individual to like, okay, now how do I go to the Social Security office? Any guidance that we can provide would be helpful. So what we are working on, I met with the Medicare, our team. We're going to have, they're working on a one pager right now that we're going to send in every single sales cycle. If it's a post, you know, follow up email and it's like, hey, you must read this. This is important. At the end of the day, those doesn't fix everything. We can say, like, hey, we can point back to a piece of paper that said, we told you how it was going to work. Right. So some of it isn't like a thatch problem, as much as like, you know, the onus is on them as well to do some education. So. We're going to get better during the sales cycle, but that starts with us fully understanding how we support on that front, which is, like, honestly, been a moving target over the past couple months. So I'll keep working with that team and we're going to have something early in January. We can start shipping out there. \nRetsy Holliday:\nAnd is that true? \nDenis Kalamar:\nYeah, because. \nKara Kubarych:\nYeah. Yeah. \nDenis Kalamar:\nSo it's actually not you like, not illegal for 65 and above. You can actually still enroll into an ACA plan if you're 65 and older. It's just going to be more, it's going to be cheaper if you go to the Medicare route, and it's going to be better benefits. But this is something that Julia and I are seeing for 3G is because the Medicare rep actually kind of screwed up the timing. And they're not going to actually be enrolled into the Medicare plan until the end of January or further. And so in the meantime, he actually enrolled into an ACA plan, and he's like 67, and he's doing that for the seven Medicare folks. Oh, interesting. \nRetsy Holliday:\nAs like a stop gap. So, like, they're actually going to like healthcare.gov. Signing up for a plan there, they'll reimburse that in the interim until the Medicare plan comes out of the platform and then they can switch it. Or that is that, yeah. Do you need a qualifying life event to be able to switch from the AC, like the on exchange plan to this Medicare plan? \nDenis Kalamar:\nSo that's what we're trying to figure out right now. The hub Medicare person like, actually enrolled in any set, it should be fine. But. But the issue is is that if you're enrolled in an ACA plan, like you're in the Medicare enrollment process and then you sign up for an ACA plan, that's not legally compliant. But if you don't start the enrollment process, then you can sign up for the ACA plan. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOh, interesting. But don't they need to get their applications in now in order to? \nDenis Kalamar:\nIt's only six months within the timeframe of when they're Medicare eligible. So, six months previously and six months post. Okay. So that's why, like. I think that just the guidance on kind of what we're saying as sales reps needs to align with, kind of. like, because we've been getting called out a few times from Medicare reps. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, no doubt. So you're saying my 95 year old is not going to be able, this wouldn't work for my 95 year old. Since he's been eligible for Medicare for 30 years. \nDenis Kalamar:\nHonestly, like, I don't have full confidence in anything. Medicare. This is like, I'm just like going around the channel. It's like, but I do know. 65 and above, you can go to the ACA marketplace. You don't have to enroll into Medicare if you don't want to. \nRetsy Holliday:\nAll right. \nKara Kubarych:\nGood to know. But also just share, this doesn't answer all the questions and definitely a lot more to discuss, But this support page has been updated with some of the FAQs we've been getting during OEP. So some of these questions are in there. I wouldn't say the answers are all like spot on or like fully helpful yet, but this is worth taking a scan through. And then. Yeah, I know so Lauren, Jeremy and Hillary joined our CST meeting. Or we did like a little one-off training with them last week, and there was like, so much more we didn't even get to. But um, I know that I am got a little bit more clarity there, so feel free to collab, um, on that topic as well in the near term. \nZach Egan:\nOkay, cool, um, and yeah, we're gonna do a train with that team,'s gonna lead a training and we'll have the updated, like customer facing docs. Early Jan, is the plan. So that'll be something we all need to align on and figure out, because I think everyone thinks about it a little bit differently. All right, pipeline, a little bit lighter one today because we're only focused on two ones. There's a lot in here that is like three ones and four ones. We're only going to focus on two ones. So let's start with the only one in due diligence, RETC with Tiro. \nRetsy Holliday:\nUm, yeah, so this one is the one that Caitlin and I've been working for a while now. He went to Amsterdam to meet with the co founders and was like, Hey, we're not making decisions fast enough, but we are still excited about that. So we're checking in with him this week, feeling decent about it. Um, this is a group who's not offering benefits today. So it's just a question of, like, are they willing to pull the trigger for two one? Or are they going to continue to drag their feet? They came to us because they want to offer benefits to retain and attract talent. Like, that is their goal. So, strategically, that hasn't changed. It's just a matter of whether or not they want to fork up money for this right now, or if it ends up happening later in the year. \nZach Egan:\nYeah. OK. And I think, given 2.1 is, like, important, more so for us than for them, I think you could proactively be like, hey, like. And you could even do like the classic sales type conversation where it's like, you know, hey, our end of year is 2.1. We're incentivized as sellers to bring on as much business as possible. So, with that being said, like, we're willing to, you know, discount x percent if you're willing to move now versus mid year. \nRetsy Holliday:\nAnd we can make that like, you know, we've already matched their venture Peppum. So we're at a $20 peppum right now with them. \nZach Egan:\nAnd no, no broker? \nRetsy Holliday:\nNo broker. \nZach Egan:\nYeah. I mean. \nRetsy Holliday:\nGo lower. \nZach Egan:\nI, if we, if we need to, I think we'd be willing to go as low as we possibly can to make this. A two one versus a three one, for sure. Cool. \nRetsy Holliday:\nSo I will talk to Michael this week. \nZach Egan:\nCool. Um, all right. And then, uh, next Resi KMC wraps auto home life are all. There's two ones. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYep, yep, KMC is a, uh, split off of lazy boy, it's all of the non-lazy boy branded furniture. Um, they're starting their own business, and so Caitlyn and I have done the cost analysis with the UM founders. They're great guys, they're super interested in that um, and very lovely to chat with. I will say our quote like we did every variation, dynamic MAC, MAC, flat cost. And we are still coming in like $200,000, $300,000 more than what they were expecting to spend. But they're also getting the same quotes from group. And so it sounds like we're definitely in the running. But we have not, I don't know. We presented the quote on like Thursday of last week. So we told them to go play around with it. They are going to do carve out. So they have hourly, part-time. And then they have incentive-based sellers. Um, so we've done different quotes for each group, um, and we're working through the process with them of evaluating each quote. So we shall see. \nZach Egan:\nThe renewal is two, one. \nRetsy Holliday:\nThey're not, they don't need a um, sorry, they're creating like a new business, and so the business, yeah, they're like, there is no renewal. \nZach Egan:\nThey're technically a virgin group, but they are coming from, um, from Lazy boy, okay, and in comparison to the like lazy boy, census or numbers were 200k more expensive. \nRetsy Holliday:\nWe're actually more like three to 400K. But they said that that is what they've been getting quoted in the group space. So they said that they had one quote that was much lower than us, but the quality of benefits was much worse. So I'm going to be real. The numbers don't look great for them. And honestly, the employee experience is not great either. When we did our disruption employee net, our actual analysis, doing a silver one or a silver 25 for some of these groups was not. Employees were not in a great spot. And so we explained that to them. And they get to decide whether or not they want to increase their budget, or if they're okay with that. Um, but they did say they are using benefits as a way to retain the talent that they are taking away from. Lazy Boy Gotcha, Okay? \nZach Egan:\nAnd they're on their own internal payroll system. \nRetsy Holliday:\nUh, yes, they have their own in-house. \nZach Egan:\nYeah, we won't, we won't get our hopes up, but we'll keep it close. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, I'm going to check in with them this week. They're really genuine and kind. And, like, I know that they'll be real with us, and whether or not this is realistic. Yeah. \nZach Egan:\nOkay. Next one on here is wraps. \nRetsy Holliday:\nSo met with them. This is the, There's 85 Medicare eligible employees. This is the one I called you about, Zach. Yeah. \nZach Egan:\nYeah. \nRetsy Holliday:\nSo yeah, we pushed them to a two one because obviously they called us last week and wanted to do a one one. And we said no. And they're very interested and very intrigued. The numbers for a group, the average of this group is like 59 years old. It's, yeah, it's an interesting cohort of employees. But that being said, the quote is actually very competitive. They're super interested. They are concerned about the Medicare experience. I'm going to be very transparent. They're like, wait, what are they going to have to do? How are these employees going to go through that workflow? But I'm pinging, I back-channeled the paychecks, rep. And told her that. realistically, we would like a decision by the end of this week, early next week, if we want a successful 2-1 with this group. Yeah. So. \nZach Egan:\nOkay. And then knowing what we know about Medicare, or, like, kind of know. At this point, I want to talk to Jeremy and just be like, what other questions do we need to ask? Because if we're going to support the 85, I just, I mean. Foresee it now. Like, we'll get them in there and then they'll be like, some question will come our way of, like, Hey, are they all, you know? Do they already go through Social security process or whatever it is? So, yeah, um, we'll just get, uh, I'll make a note just to, like, get ahead of the Medicare piece and like, actually work with that team to formalize a plan. \nRetsy Holliday:\nCool if it, it makes everybody feel a little bit better, he did. The owner did say he thinks about 10 of the 85 would actually enroll, and he's like, the rest of them would unlikely enroll. So... You know, that obviously that 10 is a digestible number. 85 is not. And so I'm not as concerned after our second call when he said he thinks only 10 would actually enroll. \nZach Egan:\nOkay, perfect. That's super nice. All right. Anything we can do to support there? Otherwise, your last one on here. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYep. Home life. Yes, there it is. Yeah. Home Life, um, USI Referral had a lovely call with the decision makers last week. She was emailing me over the weekend, asking me for like, how do I see SBCs? and asking for the quote again on a different monitor. So they're definitely playing around with it. They're very intrigued. Um, the USI, USI team feels like this is their only option, the Home Life's team, only option that would make sense for them next year. And I am. I've sent a note to the USI brokers today asking for whether or not they think it's realistic for us to have a decision by end of week as well. So feeling decent about that one, probably out of the three, that is the highest likelihood here of moving forward. \nZach Egan:\nOkay, sweet. Anything the CPM team can do on the USI front sounds like they're fully bought in. \nRetsy Holliday:\nThey're great. Yeah, we have a great relationship with Casey and Chris, and they're definitely advocating for us. They're actually sidebarring us and asking questions about that as well. So they're super engaged and we're feeling like a good co-selling team right now. \nZach Egan:\nCool. Kara K, Do we, I know we sent out, is Kara still here? Maybe not. \nJulia Korzeniowski:\nMaybe doing something. Okay. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nOn mute, but she might be here. Okay. \nZach Egan:\nIf you're there or Julia, you might be able to help. I know we sent like a lot of gifts to brokers. I don't think it was current clients. It was just brokers recently. Like, we had the gift box. Is that, like, can we do those as one officer? Was that like a mass shipment through Allie and her team that we weren't involved in? \nJulia Korzeniowski:\nWe did a mass send, but I do know that. Your we can do and we can send one, we can send one off. And he created a channel this week, and Chad is in it, clearly, um. Asking if there were any one-offs. She also said she had a few extra gifts laying around. \nZach Egan:\nSo shall we rip one to this USI crew team? \nChad Schneider:\nWe have it, that'd be great. \nZach Egan:\nOkay to do that, there's a workflow. It sounds like Jules and Chad? \nChad Schneider:\nYeah, Rusty, just send me the info for the guy. I'll get it in there. Cool. \nRetsy Holliday:\nPerfect. Thanks, Chad. \nChad Schneider:\nGot it. Nice. \nZach Egan:\nAll right. And then, Tom, this is the mid-year one. Mine's mid-year. We're looking light on two ones, which means we cleaned it up, which is good. Dennis, oh, LFC. Meeting last week was. Was good. What was what the next steps look like? Here? \nDenis Kalamar:\nI have a meeting with them for the middle of January to kind of evaluate it with their broker. They're not in a huge rush for a 2-1, but I do think that for a 3-1 this could be potential as well. \nZach Egan:\nOkay, so we're meeting in mid-January is the next call. Yeah, so let's, I'm just gonna move it out. Just given. Like if we meet, even if we get like the verbal on January 15th. Like we would have already need to start enrollment for a 2-1, right? \nDenis Kalamar:\nAnd so that's, that's like a lot of these, like larger ones, where it's either self funded groups, It's just not realistic to try and get a commitment at the beginning. And especially because they have, I think, 25 Medicare, Medicare eligible employees in New York. \nZach Egan:\nYeah, okay, well, we'll table it for now, then any? That kind of sums up the two ones. So we just have a handful in flight, anything else from the team that's relevant for a 2-1. We're looking tight on pipeline, folks. All right. Well, I think it's expected. This happened last year, too. I can probably count, on one hand, how many 2-1s were actually in play for mid-market. So, with that being said, this LFC1, Dennis, anything that's a 3-1 or early next year. Like, that's just where our energy is going to need to pivot. Like, it's very unlikely we can pull these up unless we can somehow incentivize if we're moving our pep them down to, you know, 10, But not for LLC specifically. Dennis. I mean, like any other ones around that three, one timeframe, four ones, where it's like, Hey, if you lock in now, we can get you like a $10 pep on things like that. Very open and willing to do that. But like, obviously this is an interesting space where we, not like traditional software, where you can make that move anytime you want. So. Um, yeah, we'll keep doing what we can for these couple of two ones, that'll be the focus and everything else we're on to early next year. Any questions, comments, concerns from the squad? \nDenis Kalamar:\nThe Providence Network? Is that going to be updated within the new quoting tool, Cory said, potentially by the end of the month. Do we have, like, a little bit more of a solid timeline for that? \nZach Egan:\nI do not know. I can check with. You're asking if the new the quoting tool will have those updates. \nDenis Kalamar:\nYeah. \nZach Egan:\nHonestly, it should. But let me, let me make a note to pin Corey about that. \nDenis Kalamar:\nOK. I have a couple opportunities specifically, like in the Tahoe, El Dorado and Nevada area, that the Providence network expansion would make a huge. \nZach Egan:\nUm, and therefore for next year, I take it. \nDenis Kalamar:\nYeah, well, one of them is for a 2-1. I just don't think realistically it makes sense with them until we get like those numbers to even kind of formulate, even proposing a 2-1 uh, transition. But I do think maybe a mid-year. This is for Edgewood, um, Edgewood companies. \nZach Egan:\nOkay, I think if let's, let's act like it's live, uh, I'll get more intel to make sure like we'll be available by 2.1, But even if it doesn't like populate in the tool, if we're still hinting out, like, hey, by the time they enroll, they're also going to have Providence, that could be enough. But let me get more clarification from Corey before we go too deep there. \nDenis Kalamar:\nAll right. Sounds good. \nZach Egan:\nAll right. Anything else, team? \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYes. Does anyone have deals for like 4.1, 5.1? Maybe just for one that are like tracking well that we could book in January? \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, I got one. I'm pushing hard on L.J. Rogers and offering 2025 pricing to try to get that done, even though I'm kind of, you know, not sure what 2026 pricing looks like, but I'm offering 2025 pricing. But it's good. It's 210, 110 enrolled, or 108 enrolled. It's a trucking company based out of North Carolina. So we, Caitlin and I spent an hour with them. We've done the initial pitch and then Caitlin and I spent an hour with them last week to do their like full employee disruption analysis. So it went really well. They were excited. No, I made that up, Dennis. fails. So they were very excited about the employee disruption analysis. And then Danielle called me yesterday and said that. She's doing another meeting with them on it and this week or early next week. So I'm pushing hard to get them to sign. I said, you just need to sign the contract by 2-1 and get preferred pricing. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYeah. I mean, even though fiscal, you know, fiscal ends. 2-1 just for the team, like any bookings, you know, before 2-1 is obviously things that will improve our fiscal year. So hopefully we get some more of these in the coming weeks as well. \nRetsy Holliday:\nTom, that was one question for me was like, we book it, we get the contract signed by 2-1, but then enrollments 4-1, Do those enrolled lives count for 2025 enrolled lives or for 2026? \nTom Hemmingsen:\n2026, But in terms of like, you know, our business, especially next year, as we continue to move up market, like bookings, are going to become more and more important, right? So like Q1. Of next year. We're obviously want to get a lot of enrollments based off whatever our numbers are, but the more bookings we can let. Level on top of that is is beneficial too. So um, so, yeah, it's always like, top actually enrolled is best, that's real revenue. But you know, we've, we've shown that also, like when people sign contracts with us, like, for the most part, our hit rate is very strong on those. So, but yeah, it'd be just like something we could tell. You know, investors and the board and stuff. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nCool, ask a question. It's a little random. \nZach Egan:\nIf we have spare time, go for it. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nSo for some deals that are like Land and Expand, have we considered how the AES will be involved? Like, Retsy and I just got off of this deal that has one person in New Mexico, so there's so coming to us for a carve out, But it would be beneficial for her to remain involved. And she already has all of the context. And right now, the way our team is structured is that CS should be owning that, but really, it's a little outside of their scope. As far as I know, and feel free to correct me, if this is changing, there is no real incentive for upsells. So are we considering that as we're going forward and growing as a business? \nZach Egan:\nSo. Yes, absolutely. And we've hinted the idea of a potential account management team that owns renewals and upsells. And that's their sole purpose, which has been how I've seen it in traditional Saas in the past. It is still very up in the air. I think right now the goal is to get sales reps out of the sales cycle so they can focus on the next new business. But in this case, I had a group called Invata. I wanted to do a Texas carve out with like five people, but they were 250. And it's like, as a sales rep, I selfishly also want to be involved in that. So I think as those come up now and with no structure in place, let's just take them as one-offs. Like, honestly, like rats, if you want to be involved post-sale on that one, like, I would just say, let's partner with, you know, Julia and Karen, the CS team, to make sure we're all like, lockstep on this. Or, like, if you come to periodic check-ins to help out, how you can. Awesome. But. Well, we also, we just got to get on the same page with the teams. But for now, current state, I'm all for it. If it's going to lead to expansion. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nThanks. That makes sense. And I wouldn't be surprised if that's the way some of the larger groups also approach it, just knowing that it's a change. \nZach Egan:\nFor sure. I think, yeah, we'll see what future that looks like, too. And like the enterprise space, like, you know, if you're holding on to just a handful of accounts and focusing on upsells, like, there's. Right now, the main way that we upsell is increased enrollment. And there's also potential changes in the future with the marketplace. But yeah, it's in the adolescent stages of any kind of plan. So we'll just do it as a one-off for now. Thank you. All right, squad. Anything else? See you out there. Thank you. \nRetsy Holliday:\nThanks, guys. \n",

Usually, that happens when there's an external email on the invite. \nAndrew Solomon:\nYeah, right? Mine doesn't add on these internal ones anymore. \nZach Egan:\nIf someone crashed in a party. \nAndrew Solomon:\nDonnie? \nZach Egan:\nDude, you got some lights in that room or no? \nDonny Ho:\nThat's a sick day today. So no, no, not not trying to overstimulate myself. \nZach Egan:\nDamn dude, hopefully you can take it easy. Yeah, Zach, you want to, you think? \nAndrew Solomon:\nI think I know what it is. Uh, on this invite and Julia's Aol.com email is on it. So I think it's recognizing it as there's an external somebody on the call. \nZach Egan:\nI see, I mean, I don't know. I think the most surprising thing is Julia has an AOL account. Exactly. It's a rare. \nAndrew Solomon:\nOld school. \nZach Egan:\nDo you know what else? \nDenis Kalamar:\nNothing much. I have a construction outside the door today, so I don't know how long that's going to go for. \nZach Egan:\nSan Francisco. Where'd you get that hat? \nDenis Kalamar:\nThis one? Yeah, it's, uh, it was in the box they sent us a couple, a couple months ago. Cool. \nZach Egan:\nMust have been nice. \nAndrew Solomon:\nYeah, it was for new hire, Zach. It was just a couple months late, so I don't think you made the cut. \nZach Egan:\nI see, I see. I missed out on a lot of swag. Extras. \nPatricia Gorla:\nNo, this is the extras are in the meeting room, actually right below. Inspire Optimism meeting room right below the TV snag. \nZach Egan:\nOne in San Francisco, isn't it? That's a different one he's got, though. It's like a relaxed fit. \nAndrew Solomon:\nThere's more. Send them our way. \nZach Egan:\nZach I'm in office so I could figure it out pretty quick. I'll give it a peek. All right, team, Happy Tuesday. I didn't realize there's a product off-site in office, so it's myself and, uh, the whole product team somewhere over here. But I wasn't allowed to have the breakfast tacos that were in the kitchen today, I wasn't, it was product only. \nAndrew Solomon:\nSo you're kidding? \nZach Egan:\nNo, they, well, I'm not, but then. But then Adler was like, All right, Jack, go ahead, so I guess you can, I. \nAndrew Solomon:\nI felt I felt guilty, but I did eat like three of them, so that's probably why they knew that was coming. \nZach Egan:\nYeah, this guy can do some damage. All right, squad. A little pipeline review action. First and foremost, has everyone updated their 2-1s? Heard the request last week. Is 2-1s feeling squeaky clean? If not, it's okay. But speak up or forever hold your peace, because we need these. I got a ping from Gary this morning that we need these done. It was good. Sully, good. Red Sea. Yeah. OK, cool. Kara, how are you doing? \nKara Kubarych:\nGood. I'm like, just starting to pick my head up and think about what's in the pipeline for next year. So, yeah, that's exciting. Also. Huge kudos, everyone. I feel like we landed in a really good spot as of last night on all the 1215 mid-market groups. So, yeah, good stuff. \nZach Egan:\nWell, and kudos to your team, Kara, because I think last night we had like over 300k in ARR from like booked members just from last night, which is unreal. But if you all haven't seen it, like if you check in on your ops and... Kind of how they progress, like I had Metasource had 60 enrolled last week, they ended at 260. Like, super impressive. Napalm was at like 600 for a while, they ended, or are close to 1200 at this point. Um, so the push has been huge. \nKara Kubarych:\nYeah, and we've had one other quick note there, exactly, we've had very few at this point. We're going to look through all the data today, tomorrow. Um, that has underperformed the expected enrolled significantly, like using 80 as a threshold. Almost all of the mid markets have been at or above, in some cases far above, which is pretty stellar. Um, and of course, there are lots of factors that drive that, um, so so that I think, you know, that's really exciting. There are still a few that we want to keep pushing through the end of this week. So 12 19 is the deadline extension. I think everybody knows that almost everybody got extended. We don't expect there will be like a ton of movement, though. Um, and Yeah, I was just going to say, I think there was a lot of last minute changes or like improvements, which is also just like power of procrastination, which is pretty wild. But yeah, people have like questions or anything you want to flag to me about groups that you are at all concerned about. Please, please do. But again, I think the communication has been really good and appreciate y'all working really closely with implementation managers through this process. Yeah. \nZach Egan:\nThank you, Carol. Maybe we start there. Is there any care that you're seeing that we are, like, tracking well behind on that we should talk about at the top of the call? \nKara Kubarych:\nYeah, let me just look at the latest list here real quick. Oh, what I was going to say, I was like, I know I lost my train of thought on something. Of course, the slack distracted me. We didn't have that expected enrolled number for a few, you know, not that many in the AHL's cohort. And thank you for kind of cuing it and updating it a few. Weeks ago. I know Zach helped organize that. We've pinged here and there where they've been missing because it's not a calculated field, right? So you actually have to add it in Salesforce. So I know a bunch of those have been backfilled, so thank you. But that metric has probably been the most powerful. And I know Chris and team have had, Bob, definitely eyes on that of the expected enrolled versus expected enrolled. So please, please keep filling that out moving forward. It's really helpful. And then if you do have any that are blank, But at this point, I think on this team, we're really good. You know, just continue to add that in because it's been a great stat and we'll build like more scalable reporting around it here. I can share my screen super fast just so people can see this list and then I'll let y'all move on. Let me just filter to the relevant groups real quick. \nZach Egan:\nAnd while you do that, Kara, I just dropped the spreadsheet in chat. This team has been Awesome. I think there's only a handful that are still outstanding. Retsi, it looks like you have about 50, but they're all just the separated Eins from the 30 plus Ein group. So we don't know that one. \nKara Kubarych:\nElko did really well, by the way, I think over 100. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOver 100 enrolled? \nKara Kubarych:\nOver 100% expected. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOh, yes. Okay. I was like, that's not what I saw this morning, but that, there we go. Yes. I was like, Oh my God, I'm excited. Yeah, Zach, I did just so, you know, I don't know if Andrew's on this call, but I asked Andrew, about that one. Um, or just about like, could we, um, somehow update the expected based on the enrollment list that we received from the UM? And he was like, I'm going to try to do that at like, a, I'm not manually going to go into all. \nZach Egan:\nNo, no, no, I like track that. \nRetsy Holliday:\nBut Andrew did say he thought he could do this at like a higher level. So we might get a better, we might get better detail there. \nZach Egan:\nYeah, yeah, no worries. And I pinged him this morning as well. I think worst case scenario, we'll just look at the aggregate number for assumed. And just, you know, I don't know if it's if we need to dive into each EIN, if we do this as a whole. So no action. \nKara Kubarych:\nOn that, Zach, really quick. I don't know. I think this is up to date. This is what he put together, and I can ping your all's way as an aggregate. I think this is correct. So this has overall enrollment rate, and then it has the all the EINs. I think those are the four. Is there anyone else that's a multi Ein in this team's cohort that we're missing? \nRetsy Holliday:\nNo, those are my two. \nZach Egan:\nThat's, yeah, not that I know of. Cool. \nKara Kubarych:\nSo, yeah, let me share this, because this is actually like a great little thing, he spun up. Go ahead. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYeah, just I just see it right there. The belonging medical group that are like. Partners That's one of mine that has two eins. Yeah, okay, sweet. So yeah, this, I think, is probably better. \nKara Kubarych:\nLike it was just too hard to merge into that sheet, but keep going. \nZach Egan:\nZACH Yeah, that's good. Yeah, if we're good here, we can. Just like rets. I can use this for Andrew, can use this to update that you don't need to worry about it. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOkay, thank you. \nZach Egan:\nAnd then the only other ones I saw in here, Uh, Sully, you had a handful, uh, if you can pop into the doc that I put in chat, it's rows 17 through 19. And then an expected enrollment was not like a required field. It's basically, uh, the purpose is, if we think it's going to vary from the assumed enrollment. Like what they had last year, like, let's say they had 100 enrolled last year, but then they like, aggressively slashed their benefits. They're offering like silver one at 70 we think will be a dip. It's it's our best, like crack at what we think it should be. So that way the CS team can go in and be like they're they're tracking behind. But it's actually in line with what's expected, based on Sully's conversations, right? Maybe we shouldn't push super hard in this group, things like that. Cool, exactly, yeah. \nAndrew Solomon:\nI had a question on that. Because I went back. And I just double checked to make sure that they were in salesforce and they weren't. They were in salesforce, but they weren't porting over. So should you want me to show this manually, Adam here? \nZach Egan:\nYeah, if you could, was it the expected enrollment field that was filled out? I think there's like three different enrollment fields. \nAndrew Solomon:\nYeah, there's like, assumed and then expected. I'd made sure that they were all filled in. Um, so I don't know if they just weren't pulling over, but I'll go in here and double check them and add them. \nZach Egan:\nOkay, I'm looking now and I'm not seeing it as right here. Let me grab the screen share real quick. \nKara Kubarych:\nYeah, and then I think we're looking at something similar, but I'll come back to my list. I was just filtering Andrew's latest because he just dropped this in, like, Uh, I'm looking right here solely on the right. \nZach Egan:\nExpected enrollments. Yeah. \nAndrew Solomon:\nMartin called out the one I didn't do. I see. \nKara Kubarych:\nHey, it's helpful. \nZach Egan:\nNo, thank you. \nAndrew Solomon:\nSeriously. \nZach Egan:\nI did for mine. I knocked mine out this morning. I had like a handful that were blank. So, no, it's not a required field. So no worries. \nAndrew Solomon:\nI gotcha. All right, team. \nZach Egan:\nKara, anything else you want to chat over? \nKara Kubarych:\nNo, let me hear. Now that I've got this filter down to what I. Have been generally looking at. Let me just pull this up and then I'll let y'all keep running. I don't think there's anything that will be super surprising on here. Oh, here, the other thing is, let's look at all the ones that are end date of 12-15. You can see this interesting dance that we've all been doing. All right. So I think this should be the right cohort. But yeah, looking in here. So, like Red Sea, I guess we didn't have it for Lund Stoller. Does that sound, right? \nRetsy Holliday:\nExpected enrollment? We did. I manually put this in, too. It was supposed to be 140, and we're at 177. \nKara Kubarych:\nOkay, amazing. Well, we're doing super great for whatever reason. And again, some of this, I think, is just systems wonkiness. And then, Zach, perfect game. Did you have that one? \nZach Egan:\nIt should be in there. Expected was like a 130, and they just eclipsed that last night. Amazing. \nKara Kubarych:\nOkay. So minus those, the only one that's a little bit low, but when you add them up, Tom, is these two. So I think their total is at like 90 something percent. And I know they were tough. So that was huge. Arc ended in a really good spot. Metasource was challenging, and they came up significantly. 3G, Dennis came up to 92, which was a big increase, and they were really low there for a while. And then I think I just pulled out some of. Um, your all of yours, Retzi. I can pull them back. I just was trying to hide those couple. Um, uh, so I don't know now what's going on. All the sphinx and Elko, Yeah, yeah, I think yours are all. Maybe just to let you guys get back to your meeting. Anything you want to shout out or concerned about? Retzi? \nRetsy Holliday:\nNo, no, no, no. I think they're both good. I know Elko's in a good spot. I think Sphinx is like one employee across every location. It's like going to be hard to, we'll see where we shake out. They had 45 previously enrolled out of 400, and they thought that there was going to be an increase in enrollment on thatch. So I think I bumped it up by like 10 e's from previous enrollment. But no, I don't think there's much more we can do there. Okay. \nKara Kubarych:\nAnd I realize there are a couple of 1222s in here. Okay. Well, if, for whatever reason, people want to try to add backfill these couple one more time in Salesforce, go for it. But otherwise, yeah, the numbers are really good and we'll do another push on a handful of these through end of week. So yeah, good stuff. Awesome. \nZach Egan:\nThanks, Kara. And before we jump into it, Retsi, I think we should start with Len Stoller's group, just so everyone's on the same page with the recent Medicare conversations as well. I'll let you give like the general overview of like the speed bump we're facing. And then we'll kind of game plan as a group on what we could potentially do to help them out. Even though it looks kind of tight. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, I mean the from an enrollment perspective, they've blown it out of the water. We were 140 previously enrolled, we're at 177 as of today, so that's great. There, um, I made it very clear, like six times, to the broker, that the owners could not. Len Stoller himself could not participate on the plan. Um, Len Stoller is 95 years old, and then Len Stoller's son, I guess, is like 68 years old. Um, and so they're both going on to Medicare, so it has been pretty, um, this is a new broker for us. And he, uh, he is um old school and wants like, a lot of support and a lot of handholding. And so we've had many calls about how he needs to go support these two guys get on Medicare plans. His as a very generous offer, Jeremy gave Shelly, the Medicare agent, to the son, Barry, so that he could get enrolled on Medicare. And now, as of yesterday, the broker is telling me he just realized that. The 95 year old Len Stoller is on the group plan and hasn't been set up to be like, get onto a Medicare plan yet. So it's just creating. Some, some stress. Um, Andy is just a high anxiety kind of guy and so he brings a lot of that energy into everything that we do. Um, so I gave him Jeremy's personal calendar like Calendly Link today to meet with Jeremy and talk to him. Um, I mean, in this situation like, I think the overall feedback that is relevant for this call is that our Medicare, uh, workflow right now is not sufficient. It's it is not. And we got to witness that on site, for anybody who went on site like it was. You know, you're pushing the population who is the most tech challenged to go use tech. And you would think that like, since, you know, scheduling a calendar link isn't that hard, but for that population, it is. Um, opening a computer is overwhelming for some of those folks. And so, um, we are working through this now. I think we've been called out rightfully. So by the broker that the Medicare process we have today is not sufficient and does not actually support this population. So we are working through this. But I think the S-Corp owners and needing Medicare support from them is more of like, I put this a little bit on the broker. Like, the broker needs to own this. And but we are doing our best to also support him because he is just a very, he's an anxious dude. And he really is looking to us to guide him through this process because it's his first ICRA. \nZach Egan:\nSo did the call get scheduled with Jeremy today? \nRetsy Holliday:\nAnd I haven't heard back yet. I sent him the calendar link, Calendly link and have not gotten a response yet. So it might just resolve itself. That's my hope. Is that Andy and I don't talk today? That's not going to happen. Yeah, probably not. No, we're like, around, we're averaging five times a day right now. So, you know, it is what it is. But I think it's a good, it's a good call out. We have a gap in our business right now. Medicare is not, our Medicare workflow is not sufficient for that population right now. \nZach Egan:\nYeah. And I think. \nKara Kubarych:\nCan I ask you a quick question? Is it, Retsi, and I totally hear you, lots of issues with Medicare, escalations, all sorts of things. Do you think it's largely around the product and people not knowing how to make an account and go through the form and schedule with an advisor? Or is it the advisor availability? Or is it that we're giving misinformation or lack of information on what is required for Medicare enrollment? Do you have a sense of what the biggest buckets are? \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, I mean, I think that you nailed them. I think number one is actually number one is that like people who come like, we had somebody come in, in person at Elko, who has chosen to be on group and not on Medicare. And when we told her, that was no longer an option. She was furious. She literally got very angry and walked out on us. And so I think, like one, this is not a thatch thing. This is an icra thing. When you go onto an ICRA, you have to, if you are Medicare eligible, you have to go on Medicare. And so I actually think it's probably something in the sales cycle that we all need to be doing a little bit more education and talking about more upfront. Hey guys, your Medicare eligible employees have to go on to thatch. It's not an option. Also what the, and we talk a lot about like, and what that means from an allowance perspective and turning QME on and off. But we don't talk about, like, this is what it's going to look like for those employees. Here's a full deck that, like, and I think the CS team does have those assets that come in during implementation, but it needs to be more upfront. It needs to be shared earlier on in the sales cycle so that it isn't such a surprise, especially if they have a large Medicare population. And then I really like, I think at the end of the day, Okay. The workflow itself, Kara, like when you go in and first, yes, creating an account, Like, we had one woman at Elko literally sit down and point to the computer and say, I don't, I don't know how to do that. And she's literally talking about opening a computer. Like, it is very overwhelming for this population to have to, To find something in their email, click on that link, go Create their account. And then from there, the two options, the workflow options are enter this, your information into this Google Form. That's hard. Like, I sat next to somebody and walked her through how to do that. And she had her Social Security page with her right there in that moment and, like, had all of the information she needed. She still didn't feel comfortable doing this by herself. And then I think, when you bring, if you need to go shopping for a plan, The fact that, like, we were on site and then we were like, oh, you're going to meet with a Medicare agent in four days from now. They were like, no, I don't want to meet with a Medicare agent in four days from now. I'm here now to get this done. And I don't want to wait. And so I think it's a combination of everything that you said, Kara. But I, you know, those are like the bigger buckets that, I would say, are the pain points. The feedback that I have received from multiple brokers now is you need a phone number for the Medicare population. They know how to use a cell phone. They know how to call somebody. That is what they are comfortable doing. Push like multiple people at Elko told us, we don't have laptops. So like, we set up phone. Literally, Megan is a frickin rock star on product. She sat down and downloaded. Google meet on somebody's cell phone so that they could meet with the advisor in four days from when we met with them. But I don't think anything's going to come from that. Like, they're, they're not able to enter anything onto their phone. They're not, they're confused on how to do that. So I think a phone number is how you solve it for this population. \nZach Egan:\nYeah. Yeah. And we are between this group. We are going to have a phone number next year and it is in the works. We're not. Talking about it, or like, making promises now, because that timeline is very TBD. But that's the top priority for Gary. And it's for this exact reason, amongst many other reasons. Do I think it'll, like, solve all of these problems? no, but it'll give them someone who can perhaps direct them on how to do it. Um, I think the most challenging thing. That development I've seen as of late is like, my personal understanding of how we support in the Medicare front was just not correct. Like I sent that began spoke to our prospects, saying, hey, we help folks enroll in parts A and B. We do not. We can help with Part D and supplementals, but the onus is on the individual. And I think the biggest pushback I've heard is for brokers, some of them are equipped to do this. Some feel like it shouldn't be their job. But even for that individual to like, okay, now how do I go to the Social Security office? Any guidance that we can provide would be helpful. So what we are working on, I met with the Medicare team. We're going to have, they're working on a one pager right now that we're going to send in every single sales cycle. If it's a post, you know, follow up email and it's like, hey, you must read this, or this is important. At the end of the day, those doesn't fix everything. We can say, like, hey, we can point back to a piece of paper that said, we told you how it was going to work. Right. So some of it isn't like a thatch problem, as much as like, you know, the onus is on them as well to do some education. So. We're going to get better during the sales cycle, but that starts with us fully understanding how we support on that front, which is, like, honestly, been a moving target over the past couple months. So I'll keep working with that team and we're going to have something early in January. We can start shipping out there. \nRetsy Holliday:\nAnd is that true? \nDenis Kalamar:\nBecause, yeah. Yeah. So it's actually not you like, not illegal for 65 and above. You can actually still enroll into an ACA plan if you're 65 and older. It's just going to be more, it's going to be cheaper if you go to the Medicare route, and it's going to be better benefits. But this is something that Julia and I are seeing for 3G is because the Medicare rep actually kind of screwed up the timing. And they're not going to actually be enrolled into the Medicare plan until the end of January or further. And so in the meantime, he actually enrolled into an ACA plan, and he's like 67, and he's doing that for the seven Medicare folks. Oh, interesting. \nRetsy Holliday:\nAs like a stopgap. So, like, they're actually going to like healthcare.gov. Signing up for a plan there, they'll reimburse that in the interim until the Medicare plan comes out of the platform and then they can switch it. Or is that, yeah? Do you need a qualifying life event to be able to switch from the AC, like the on exchange plan to this Medicare Plan or no? \nDenis Kalamar:\nThat's what we're trying to figure out right now. The Hub Medicare person, like, actually enrolled it and he said it should be fine, but. But the issue is is that if you're enrolled in an ACA plan, like you're in the Medicare enrollment process and then you sign up for an ACA plan that's not legally compliant. But if you don't start the enrollment process, then you can sign up for the ACA plan. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOh, interesting, but don't they need to get their applications in now in order to? \nDenis Kalamar:\nIt's only six months within the time frame of when they're Medicare eligible, so six months previously in six months post. Okay. So that's why, like... I think that just the guidance on kind of what we're saying as sales reps needs to align with, kind of. Like because we've been getting called out a few times from Medicare reps. Yeah. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, no doubt. So you're saying my 95 year old is not going to be able. This wouldn't work for my 95 year old since he's been eligible for Medicare for 30 years. \nDenis Kalamar:\nHonestly, like, I don't have full confidence in anything. Medicare. This is like, I'm just like going around the channel. It's like, but I do know. 65 and above, you can go to the ACA marketplace. You don't have to enroll into Medicare if you don't want to. \nRetsy Holliday:\nAll right. Good to know. \nKara Kubarych:\nAlso, just share, this doesn't answer all the questions and definitely a lot more to discuss, But this support page has been updated with some of the FAQs we've been getting during OEP. So some of these questions are in there. I wouldn't say the answers are all like spot on or like fully helpful yet, but this is worth taking a scan through. And then. Yeah, I know so Lauren, Jeremy and Hillary joined our CST meeting. Or we did like a little one-off training with them last week, and there was like, so much more we didn't even get to. But um, I know that I am got a little bit more clarity there, so feel free to collab, um, on that topic as well in the near term. \nZach Egan:\nOkay, cool, um, and yeah. We're gonna do a train with that team,'s gonna lead a training. And we'll have the updated like customer facing docs in early Jan, is the plan. So that'll be something we all need to align on and figure it out. Cause I think everyone thinks about it a little bit differently. Um, all right. Pipeline a little bit lighter one today. Cause we're only focused on two ones. Um, there's a lot in here that is like three ones and four ones. We're only going to focus on two ones. So let's start with the only one in due diligence, Red Sea with Tiro. \nRetsy Holliday:\nUm, yeah, so this one is the one that Caitlin and I've been working for a while now. He went to Amsterdam to meet with the co founders and was like, Hey, we're not making decisions fast enough, but we are still excited about that. So we're checking in with him this week, feeling decent about it. Um, this is a group who's not offering benefits today. So it's just a question of, like, are they willing to pull the trigger for two one? Or are they going to continue to drag their feet? They came to us because they want to offer benefits to retain and attract talent. Like, that is their goal. So, strategically, that hasn't changed. It's just a matter of whether or not they want to fork up money for this right now, or if it ends up happening later in the year. \nZach Egan:\nYeah. OK. And I think, given 2.1 is, like, important, more so for us than for them, I think you could proactively be like, hey, like. And you could even do like the classic sales type conversation where it's like, you know, hey, our end of year is 2.1. We're incentivized as sellers to bring on as much business as possible. So, with that being said, we're willing to discount x percent if you're willing to move now versus mid-year. And we can make that pretty great. \nRetsy Holliday:\nWe've already matched their venture PEPM. So we're at a $20 PEPM right now with them. \nZach Egan:\nAnd no broker? \nRetsy Holliday:\nNo broker. \nZach Egan:\nYeah. I mean... \nRetsy Holliday:\nGo lower. \nZach Egan:\nI, if we, if we need to, I think we'd be willing to go as low as we possibly can to make this. A two one versus a three one, for sure. Cool. \nRetsy Holliday:\nSo I will talk to Michael this week. \nZach Egan:\nCool. Um, all right. And then. Uh, next Resi KMC wraps auto home life are all. There's two ones. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYep, yep, KMC is a, uh, split off of lazy boy, it's all of the non-lazy boy branded furniture. Um, they're starting their own business, and so Caitlyn and I have done the cost analysis with the UM founders. They're great guys, they're super interested in that um, and very lovely to chat with. I will say our quote like we did every variation, dynamic MAC, MAC, flat cost. And we are still coming in like $200,000, $300,000 more than what they were expecting to spend. But they're also getting the same quotes from group. And so it sounds like we're definitely in the running. But we have not, I don't know. We presented the quote on like Thursday of last week. So we told them to go play around with it. They are going to do carve out. So they have hourly, part-time. And then they have incentive-based sellers. So we've done different quotes for each group. And we're working through the process with them of evaluating each quote. So we shall see. \nZach Egan:\nAnd the renewal is 2.1? \nRetsy Holliday:\nThey're not, they don't need, sorry, they're creating like a new business. And so the business, yeah, there is no renewal. They're technically a Virgin group, but they are coming from Lazy Boy. \nZach Egan:\nOkay. And in comparison to the like, lazy Boy. Census, or numbers, were 200k more expensive? \nRetsy Holliday:\nWe're actually more like three to 400k. But they said that that is what they've been getting quoted in the group space. So they said that they had one quote that was much lower than us, but the quality of benefits was much worse. So I'm going to be real. The numbers don't look great for them. And honestly, the employee experience is not great either. Like when we did our disruption employee net, like our actual analysis, doing a silver one or a silver 25 for some of these groups was not. Employees were not in a great spot and so we explained that to them. And they get to decide whether or not they want to increase their budget or if they're okay with that. Um, but they did say they are using benefits as a way to retain the talent that they are taking away from. \nZach Egan:\nLazy Boy Gotcha, Okay? And they're on their own internal payroll system. \nRetsy Holliday:\nUh, yes, they have their own in-house. \nZach Egan:\nYeah, we won't, we won't get our hopes up, but we'll keep it close. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, I'm going to check in with them this week. They're really genuine and kind. And, like, I know that they'll be real with us, and whether or not this is realistic. Yeah. \nZach Egan:\nOkay. Next one on here is wraps. \nRetsy Holliday:\nSo met with them. This is the, There's 85 Medicare eligible employees. This is the one I called you about, Zach. \nZach Egan:\nYeah, yeah. \nRetsy Holliday:\nSo yeah, we pushed them to a 2-1 because obviously they called us last week and wanted to do a 1-1 and we said no. And they're very interested and very intrigued. The numbers for a group, the average of this group is like 59 years old. It's, yeah, it's an interesting cohort of employees. They. But that being said, the quote is actually very competitive. They're super interested. They are concerned about the Medicare experience. I'm going to be very transparent there. Like, wait, what are they going to have to do? How are these employees going to go through that workflow? But I am pinging. I back channeled the paychecks, rep. And told her that. realistically, we would like a decision by the end of this week, early next week, if we want a successful 2-1 with this group. Yeah. \nZach Egan:\nAnd then knowing what we know about Medicare, or, like, kind of know. At this point, I want to talk to Jeremy and just be like, what other questions do we need to ask? Because if we're going to support the 85, I just, I mean, we could. Foresee it now. Like, we'll get them in there and then they'll be like, some question will come our way of, like, Hey, are they all, you know? Do they already go through Social security process or whatever it is? So, yeah, um, we'll just get, uh, I'll make a note just to, like, get ahead of the Medicare piece and like, actually work for that team to formalize a plan. \nRetsy Holliday:\nCool if it makes everybody feel a little bit better, he did. The owner did say he thinks about 10 of the 85 would actually enroll, and he's like, the rest of them would unlikely enroll. So, um. You know, that obviously that 10 is a digestible number. 85 is not. And so I'm not as concerned after our second call when he said he thinks only 10 would actually enroll. \nZach Egan:\nOkay, perfect. That's super nice. All right. Anything we can do to support there? Otherwise, your last one on here. Yep. \nRetsy Holliday:\nHome life. \nZach Egan:\nYes, there it is. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah. Home life. Um, USI Referral had a lovely call with the decision makers last week. She was emailing me over the weekend asking me for like, how do I see SBCs? and, um, asking for the quote again on a different monitor. So they're definitely playing around with it. They're very intrigued. Um, the USI, USI team feels like this is their only option. The Home Life's team, only option that would make sense for them next year. And I am. I've sent a note to the USI brokers today asking for whether or not they think it's realistic for us to have a decision by end of week as well. So feeling decent about that one, probably out of the three, that is the highest likelihood here of moving forward. \nZach Egan:\nOkay, sweet. Anything the CPM team can do on the USI front sounds like they're like fully bought in. They're great. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, we have a great relationship with Casey and Chris, and they're definitely advocating for us. They're actually sidebarring us and asking questions about that as well. So they're super engaged and we're we're feeling like a good co-selling team right now. \nZach Egan:\nCool. Kara Kay, do we? I know we sent out. Is Kara still here? Maybe not. \nJulia Korzeniowski:\nMaybe you're doing something. Bye. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nOn mute, but you might be here. Okay. \nZach Egan:\nIf you're there or Julia, you might be able to help. I know we sent like a lot of gifts to brokers. I don't think it was current clients. It was just brokers recently. Like, we had the gift box. Is that, like, can we do those as one officer? Was that like a mass shipment through Allie and her team that we weren't involved in? \nJulia Korzeniowski:\nWe did a mass send, but I do know that. Your tweet we can do, and we can send one, we can send one-offs. And he created a channel this week, and Chad is in it, clearly, um, asking if there were any one-offs. She also said she had a few extra gifts laying around. \nZach Egan:\nSo shall we rip one to this USI crew team? If we have it okay to do that? There's a workflow. It sounds like Jules and Chad? \nChad Schneider:\nYeah, Rusty, just send me the info for the guy. I'll get it in there. \nRetsy Holliday:\nPerfect. Thanks, Chad. \nChad Schneider:\nYou got it. Nice. \nZach Egan:\nAll right. And then, Tom, this is the mid-year one. Mine's mid-year. We're looking light on two ones, which means we cleaned it up, which is good. Dennis, oh, LFC. Meeting last week was... Was good. What do the next steps look like here? \nDenis Kalamar:\nI have a meeting with them for the middle of January to kind of evaluate it with their broker. They're not in a huge rush for a 2-1, but I do think that for a 3-1, this could be potential as well. Okay. \nZach Egan:\nSo we're meeting in mid-January is the next call. Yeah. So let's, I'm just going to move it out. Just given like, if we meet, even if we get like the verbal on January 15th, like we would have already needed to start enrollment for a 2-1, right? Exactly. \nDenis Kalamar:\nAnd so that's, that's like a lot of these, like larger ones, where it's either self-funded groups. It's just not realistic to try and get a commitment at the beginning. And especially because they have, I think, 25 Medicare, Medicare eligible employees in New York. Yeah. \nZach Egan:\nOkay. Well, we'll table it for now, then. Any, that kind of sums up the two ones. So we just have a handful in flight. Anything else from the team that's relevant for. A 2-1. We're looking tight on pipeline, folks. All right. Well, I think it's expected. This happened last year, too. I can probably count, on one hand, how many 2-1s were actually in play for mid-market. So, with that being said, this LFC1, Dennis, anything that's a 3-1 or early next year, like, that's just where our energy is going to need to pivot. Like, it's very unlikely we can pull these up unless we can somehow incentivize if we're moving our pep them down to, you know, 10 by. Not for LLC specifically, Dennis. I mean, like any other ones around that three, one timeframe. For ones where it's like, Hey, if you lock in now, we can get you like a $10 PEP and things like that. Very open and willing to do that. But like, obviously this is an interesting space where we not like traditional software, where you can make that move anytime you want. So. Um, yeah, we'll keep doing what we can for these couple of two ones, that'll be the focus and everything else we're on to early next year. Any questions, comments, concerns from the squad? \nDenis Kalamar:\nThe Providence Network? Is that going to be updated within the new quoting tool, Cory said, potentially by the end of the month. Do we have, like, a little bit more of a solid timeline for that? \nZach Egan:\nI do not know. I can check with. You're asking if the new the quoting tool will have those updates. Yeah. \nDenis Kalamar:\nHonestly, it should. \nZach Egan:\nBut let me, let me make a note to pin Corey about that. \nDenis Kalamar:\nOK. I have a couple opportunities specifically, like in the Tahoe, El Dorado and Nevada area, that the Providence network expansion would make a huge. \nZach Egan:\nUm, and therefore for next year, I take it. \nDenis Kalamar:\nYeah, well, one of them have scored two, one. I just don't think realistically it makes sense with them. Until we get like those numbers to even kind of formulate, even proposing a two one uh transition. But I do think maybe a mid-year. This is for Edgewood, um, Edgewood companies. \nZach Egan:\nOkay, I think if let's, let's act like it's live, uh, I'll get more intel to make sure like we'll be available by 2.1, But even if it doesn't like populate in the tool, if we're still hinting out, like, hey, by the time they enroll, they're also going to have providence, that could be enough. But let me get more clarification from Corey before we go too deep there. \nDenis Kalamar:\nAll right. Sounds good. All right. \nZach Egan:\nAnything else, team? \nTom Hemmingsen:\nDoes anyone have deals for like 4.1, 5.1? Maybe just for one that are like tracking well that we could book in January? \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, I got one. I'm pushing hard on L.J. Rogers and offering 2025 pricing to try to get that done, even though I'm kind of, you know, not sure what 2026 pricing looks like, but I'm offering 2025 pricing. But it's good. It's 210, 110 enrolled, or 108 enrolled. It's a trucking company based out of North Carolina. So we, Caitlin and I spent an hour with them. We've done the initial pitch and then Caitlin and I spent an hour with them last week to do their like full employee disruption analysis. So it went really well. They were excited. No, I made that up, Dennis. fails. So they were very excited about the employee disruption analysis. And then Danielle called me yesterday and said that. She's doing another meeting with them on it and this week or early next week. So I'm pushing hard to get them to sign. I said, you just need to sign the contract by 2-1 and get preferred pricing. \nTom Hemmingsen:\nYeah. I mean, even the fiscal, you know, fiscal ends. 2-1 just for the team, like any bookings, you know, before 2-1 is obviously things that will improve our fiscal year. So hopefully we get some more of these in the coming weeks as well. \nRetsy Holliday:\nTom, that was one question for me was like, we book it, we get the contract signed by 2-1, but then enrollments 4-1. Do those enrolled lives count for 2025 enrolled lives or for 2026? \nTom Hemmingsen:\n2026, But in terms of like, you know, our business, especially next year, as we continue to move up market, like bookings, are going to become more and more important, right? So like Q1. Of next year. We're obviously want to get a lot of enrollments based off whatever our numbers are, but the more bookings we can let. Level on top of that is is beneficial too. So um, so, yeah, it's always like, top, actually enrolled is best, that's real revenue. But you know, we've, we've shown that also, like when people sign contracts with us, like, for the most part, our hit rate is very strong on those. So, but yeah, it'd be, it'd be just like something we could tell. You know, investors and the board and stuff. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nCool, it's a question, it's a little random. If we have spare time, go for it. So for some deals that are like Land and Expand, have we considered how the AES will be involved? Like, Retsy and I just got off of this deal that has one person in New Mexico. So there's stuff coming to us for a carve out, But it would be beneficial for her to remain involved since she already has all of the context. And right now, the way our team is structured is that CS should be owning that, but really, it's a little outside of their scope, as far as I know. And feel free to correct me if this is changing. There is no real incentive for upsells. So are we considering that as we're going forward and growing as a business? \nZach Egan:\nSo... Yes, absolutely. And we've hinted the idea of a potential account management team that owns renewals and upsells. And that's their sole purpose, which has been how I've seen it in traditional Saas in the past. It is still very up in the air. I think right now the goal is to get sales reps out of the sales cycle so they can focus on the next new business. But in this case, I had a group called Embeda. I wanted to do a Texas carve out with like five people, but they were 250. And it's like, as a sales rep, I selfishly also want to be involved in that. So I think as those come up now and with no structure in place, let's just take them as one-offs. Like, honestly, like Rats, if you want to be involved post-sale on that one, like, I would just say, let's partner with, you know, Julia and Karen, the CS team, to make sure we're all like, lockstep on this. Or, like, if you come to periodic check-ins to help out how you can, awesome. But we also, we just gotta get on the same page with the teams, but for now, current state, I'm all for it. If it's going to lead to expansion. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nThanks, that makes sense. And I wouldn't be surprised if that's the way some of the larger groups also approach it, just knowing that it's a change. \nZach Egan:\nFor sure. I think, yeah, we'll see what future of Thatch looks like, too. And like the enterprise space, like, you know, if you're holding on to just a handful of accounts and focusing on upsells, like, there's... Right now, the main way that we upsell is increased enrollment. And there's also potential changes in the future with the marketplace. But yeah, it's in the adolescent stages of any kind of plan. So we'll just do it as a one-off for now. Thank you. All right, squad. Anything else? See you out there. Thank you. \nRetsy Holliday:\nThanks, guys. \n",

KEY POINTS DISCUSSED\n\nPrimary Issue Identified - ICHRA Eligibility Concern\nCRITICAL FINDING: During the call, it was discovered that the company structure presents a significant eligibility issue:\n- Company is structured as an LLC (not taxed as C-Corp)\n- Both Leticia and Jeffrey Stewart appear to be owners of the LLC\n- LLC owners do NOT qualify for ICHRA coverage through Thatch because they already receive tax benefits by including insurance as a business expense\n- Only non-owner employees would be eligible for ICHRA through Thatch\n\nPlatform Navigation & Technical Issues\n- Leticia experienced difficulty accessing the platform and viewing plan options\n- Password reset link was not initially received (potential email delivery issue)\n- Confusion about why bank account information was required before viewing plans\n- Leticia expressed frustration about the onboarding process and timing constraints\n\nPlan Structure Reviewed\n- Monthly employer allowance set at: $550 per employee\n- Example plan shown: Total cost $1,234.70 (Employer pays $550, Employee pays $684.70)\n- Plans available are similar to marketplace options but with pre-tax benefit advantage\n- No marketplace subsidies currently available to the company\n\nAlternative Recommendation Provided\n- For LLC owners: Purchase insurance directly through the marketplace (cannot use ICHRA)\n- Eligible employees (non-owners): Can be covered through Thatch ICHRA\n\n2. STAKEHOLDERS IDENTIFIED\n\n| Name | Role | Responsibilities | Eligibility Status |\n|------|------|------------------|-------------------|\n| Leticia | LLC Owner / Primary Contact | Decision maker, account administrator | NOT eligible for ICHRA (owner) |\n| Jeffrey Stewart | Co-owner/Employee | Listed in employee roster | Likely NOT eligible (appears to be owner) |\n| Taryn Livingstone | Thatch Sales Representative | Platform guidance, eligibility clarification | N/A |\n| Thatch Support Team | Technical Support | Password reset assistance (thread initiated) | N/A |\n\nNote: Leticia mentioned being referred by \"another CoD League\" member who may not be an S-Corp, suggesting she should verify their structure.\n\n3. IMPORTANT MILESTONES & TIMESTAMPS\n\nDecember 16, 2025 - Initial Onboarding Call:\n- 00:00-05:00 - Technical difficulties with login/password reset\n- 05:00-10:00 - Navigation through platform to view plan options\n- 10:00-15:00 - Review of plan costs and allowance structure ($550/month)\n- 15:00-20:00 - Discussion of company structure (LLC)\n- 20:00-25:00 - CRITICAL MOMENT: Discovery that LLC owners are ineligible for ICHRA\n- 25:00-30:00 - Clarification that only non-owner employees would qualify\n\nKey Quote from Leticia: \"I really need to get this squared away today. Like, I'm not going to have any other time for the rest of the year to get this done. This has been such a frustrating process.\"\n\n4. NEXT STEPS & ACTION ITEMS\n\nImmediate Actions Required:\n\nFor Leticia (Company Owner):\n- [ ] URGENT: Verify Jeffrey Stewart's ownership status in the LLC\n- [ ] Determine if there are any non-owner employees who would be eligible for ICHRA\n- [ ] If pursuing ICHRA for eligible employees only: Complete bank account setup in platform\n- [ ] For herself and Jeffrey (as owners): Explore marketplace insurance options directly\n- [ ] Deadline: End of year 2025 (per Leticia's stated timeline constraint)\n\nFor Thatch Team:\n- [ ] Monitor support ticket for password reset issue resolution\n- [ ] Follow up with Leticia to confirm company structure and employee eligibility\n- [ ] Provide marketplace guidance for LLC owners if needed\n- [ ] Responsible Party: Taryn Livingstone to follow up\n\nFor Referral Source Verification:\n- [ ] Leticia to check with referring \"CoD League\" member about their company structure\n- [ ] Confirm whether referral source is actually eligible (may not be S-Corp as Leticia mentioned)\n\nACCOUNT STATUS\n\nCurrent Status: ⚠️ PENDING ELIGIBILITY VERIFICATION  \nRisk Level: HIGH - Fundamental eligibility issue identified  \nOnboarding Status: Incomplete - Company not fully onboarded  \nUrgency: HIGH - Customer has year-end deadline\n\nRecommended Follow-up: Within 24-48 hours to clarify employee roster and ownership structure before proceeding with onboarding.\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES\n\n- Customer expressed significant frustration with the process\n- Time sensitivity is critical (no availability after December 2025)\n- May need to pivot strategy entirely if no non-owner employees exist\n- Consider providing clearer upfront eligibility screening for LLC structures to avoid similar situations"

            "transcript": "Taryn Livingstone:\nHello, how are you? Hey, Leticia, I'm doing well. How's it going? You know, it's so funny. I was literally about to, like, just messaging you, saying, hey, I'm about to hop on another call. And I've just realized, looking at my calendar, that that other call is you. So sorry about that confusion on my end. Okay. That's okay. That's okay. How are you doing? I'm doing well, doing well. It's a very busy time of the year, so I'm sorry this took so long to get on the calendar, but I'm really, I'm excited to chat and help out however I can. So please let me, let me know what I can do to help. Okay. All right. I'm predated of the, what the, I registered on here. I'm just trying to figure out, how do you select the different plans? Like, there's no way of looking at the plan options. So are you, let me just pull up your account here. So are you viewing, are you inside of your employer account right now? Oh, I see. So let's see. So there's you and Jeffrey Stewart. It looks like, right? Those are the two employees. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So what you'll want to do is when you log into your account. You'll see that at the top it says Your company is not fully onboarded in yellow. Do you see that? Wait, hold on one second. Why is it not letting me get there? It's weird. Okay, hold on. I'm having a hard time getting back there. Hmm. I don't think I can get there. It should just be if you go to thatch.com, right, and then click login. Yeah, I'm saying it's telling me my password is not. Let me reset it. Oh, yeah, go for it. Yeah, feel free to take your time. I have the whole 30 minutes here. Let me see something else. It's not sending me the, to let me reset the password. It's not sending me. Oh, it's not sending the link? No, oh, that's odd. Yeah, you should, you should have gotten a link if you want to reset it. Um, let's see. What I can do is I can. I can start a thread with you, me and our support team to see if they can help out there. But you should, yeah, you should have gotten a link to reset. Maybe maybe check your spam, see if it went there. Um, it might be from Hello at that shot, com Mm-mm. But I've gotten emails, so it shouldn't be a problem. I really need to get this squared away today. Like, I'm not going to have any other time for the rest of the year to get this done. Mm. Okay. This has been such a frustrating process. Yeah, totally understand there. I know it. So let's see if we can start a thread with support to get your password reset. All right, I'm in. All right, so it says. Okay, great. Your company is not fully on board. Finish onboarding. Yes, click on that. Okay, so it wants me to put the automated payment stuff in here. So my thing is this. I'm not even, why are they asking me for this if I don't even know if I'm moving forward? What plans are going to be affordable for us? Like, why do they want the bank information before I even made a decision? Oh, I see. Yeah. So the way that it works is we would set up your bank account now, because, let's see. Let me just check to see if you upload your employee. Okay. I'm just going back. Oh, I see. Okay. So what you're going to want to do then is, if you go to, um, let me see, I'm going to text you a link right now. This is the link that you'll want to go to to check out the plan selection. And also, um, set allowances for your employees. So here, let me text this to you now, this, this basically is how you can get in. Let me, okay, here we go. I just texted you a link there, so that's going to include. Um, like, when you go, click on that, you'll go to the quote page and that will let you see what the plan selections are. So when you're on this page, you'll see that there's a section down here with employees where you'd click on See Plans to see what the plan selections look like. So I have to log in to be able to see the plans? Yes. So you're going to want to, When you're logged in, you should be able to click on this link, or you can type it in, too. It's just app.thatch.com slash employers, slash onboarding, slash quote. It's a little bit long, but when you go to that, it should load your quote page. And that's going to show you two things. So you'll see what. The allowance structure is that you set for your team, but then you can also down a second. Please, because when I click on it, it's asking me to log in. Okay, yeah, so you'll want to log in again. Well, you can also do. And then why can't I get it from another option? why can't I get it from the computer version? You send the link. Um, so, basically, if you're in your account right now, the way to get to this page is you just need to click the back button a few times. So basically, you go in and you'd see, okay, it looks like it wants me to select or collect your bank account, right? Okay, now back to let's review the estimated monthly cost. I'm going back. Oh, you're going back. Okay, perfect. Yeah, just click the back button. Keep going back, back, and then we'll get to, okay, let's review your monthly cost. Go back one more time. Okay. All right, great. So do you see evolve and change allowance strategy? Yes. Okay, perfect. So scroll down. Now see where it says employees. Yes. Now, do you see the little C plans button, that little purple button there? Yes. Okay, perfect. Click on that. Okay. Now this is going to load what the plans are that are available in your area. So this is one way you can look at look through the plan options. So how do you do it? As when this be for each person would be the monthly, Okay, employee piece. Yeah, so you'll see what the employee is paying, too. So if you scroll up, you can see that right now you have it set to $550 for the allowance. You can change that. You can edit that number to be whatever you want it to be there. Okay. So they said employee pays $684.70. The employer pays the difference between the $1,234.70 and the $684.70? Correct, yeah. So right now, the employer is paying the monthly allowance of $550. So, for each plan you see, the employer contribution will be $550. Employee contribution will be basically whatever is left over that is needed to pay for the plan that you're seeing there. Is no different than what I was getting before. Yeah, so on the marketplace, you mean? We don't qualify for the get-covered subsidies. We don't qualify for any subsidies. Right. So what you're seeing here, actually, so these numbers, the difference between going to the marketplace and buying insurance and going through us is you are paying for this. Pre-tax, so basically that means that this budget is is not being taxed when it's going into paying for insurance. So you're able to save based on that. Um, so that's one, that's one difference there and then and then. Also too for your company, are you you're the owner of the company, right or no? Yes, yes, I am okay, nice. And do you know, do you? Um, do you know if you're, like, taxed as a C-Corp or an S Corp. sole proprietorship? The structure is it's LLC, LLC, okay, gotcha, and is Jeffrey also an owner? Yes, okay, so actually, I actually he, he, he, okay, gotcha. okay, so you're an LLC. So I was going to say, Leticia, actually, this is something that we should have clarified up front. But within ICRA, so an individual coverage health reimbursement arrangement, owners of LLCs wouldn't qualify for this kind of insurance anyway. The reason being that, because I mentioned this is a pre-tax allowance that's being set for your employees. Right. As an owner, you already are able to get the tax benefit. On your insurance, because you can include it as a business expense, and um, when you're, when you're doing your reporting there. So, yeah, unfortunately, I don't think that we'd be able to cover you. Um, with with the way that Thatch works any, anyhow. Okay? So then would you be able to just cover the employee? The employee? Yes, as long as they aren't an owner of the business. Please find out, because I was referred by another CoD League, and I don't think they're an S-Corp. I don't know. Okay. Yeah, I would check in. Generally speaking, for LLCs, we don't cover unless you are taxed as a C-Corp, but I rarely come across LLCs taxed as a C-Corp. All right. So you think that the employees will be eligible? You got it. Yeah, employees will be eligible. Because obviously we work with a lot of owners of LLCs. What we will tell you guys to do is just simply go to the marketplace for your plan, because that would probably be the easiest way of doing it. You just wouldn't be able to use the Icra on your plan. Okay, thank you so much. Yeah, of course. Yeah, happy to help here. Anything else I can help with as far as getting this set up? No, I'll be back in touch. Okay. Sounds good. All right. We'll connect later on. Have a great one. \n",

The plan is a unified group HSA (High Deductible Health Plan) that they have been using for approximately three to four years. \n\nThe plan features an individual deductible in the $5,000-$6,000 range and a family deductible of $11,000-$12,000. The employer contributes approximately $300-$400 per month per employee (with some variation based on age), while employees contribute 25% of the premium cost. The plan design is the same across all age bands in terms of services, with only the premium costs varying by age.\n\nThe company consistently selects the middle-tier option (Plan B) from three available tiers offered in each category (HSA, HMO, standard plan) by their current provider. The benefits package includes dental and vision coverage, which are bundled with the medical plan but paid for separately by employees at relatively low rates. The company does not contribute toward dependent coverage, though employees can purchase it at additional cost.\n\nThe company has fewer than 50 employees and offers benefits after a 90-day probationary period. The HSA component has been underutilized due to a poor user interface and administrative challenges. No specific information about the funding type (fully insured, level-funded, or self-funded) was mentioned in the conversation."

She has repeatedly asked her current insurance provider for automated ACH withdrawals but was told \"we're not there yet.\" \n\nThey work with a broker or insurance organization that provides them with group plan options. This organization offers three tiers per category (HSA, HMO, standard plans), and Maria typically selects the middle-tier option (\"Plan B\"). They've been with Primera Blue Cross and have been providing employee benefits for over a decade.\n\nAbout 1.5 years ago, a new director from a more advanced company complained about their benefits administration and introduced them to integration tools. Since then, Maria successfully implemented a 401k plan that integrates with QuickBooks, which she describes as \"a godsend\" compared to the manual health insurance and HSA processes.\n\nMaria's primary motivation for exploring Thatch is finding a solution that integrates with QuickBooks Online to automate benefits administration and eliminate the manual workflows she currently manages."

It's great. \nSeth Wood:\nIt's, you know, Q4, open enrollment, Q4, anywhere. It's just busy. It is. \nmaria:\nAnd I'm not helping by being last minute. So thanks for your patience. \nSeth Wood:\nOh, you don't, don't feel too bad, because tell you, there's groups like Mega, bigger groups that are still figuring it out. So I can't believe it, but that's how it works. So yeah. And I appreciate you jumping on a call. Realistically, I obviously want to meet, connect, but also just want to walk you through, there's going to be questions when we show you the quote. So I just want you to like, see it and we can answer in real time and make sure you understand like the tool. I appreciate that. It'll be dynamic and you can get a link today so you can start playing around with it and look at it. But, yeah, I know we've been chatting for a few weeks, so no worries. And thank you for being. I wasn't trying to be any difficult. It's just we're trying to run it as accurate as possible. So our system is going to be. \nmaria:\nOh, no, absolutely. \nSeth Wood:\nI totally happily to help make it as easy as possible with whatever we need to do. So, yeah, I know, because I know you spoke to Monica and then me. I jumped in later, but. But basically what I'll do, I'll show you the, I ran two quotes for you. I didn't want to make it too complicated, but I did want to show you the two ways you can do it. So with this model, with an ICRA, and feel free to pop in any point if you have questions, But just to highlight how it will work. You can offer, you can do two things. You can offer every person a flat dollar amount. You can say, hey, I'm giving every person very somewhat similar to what you're doing today. So if you wanted to offer everybody 360-ish. Some people have more or less, but you can give them a simple $400, whatever you decided. That's probably the most straightforward way to do it at a group your size, if you did have that. These plans are also priced on the individual market. One of the advantages to the individual marketplace is obviously they can't disqualify you for pre-existing conditions. They can't, if you're really sick or you have special needs, they're not going to charge you more for your premiums. So they can't do anything like that. The only thing they can do is price the plans by age and location. That's the only two things. So if you do have people that are a little bit older than some of the other people in your roster, those people might have just a little bit higher costs than the younger people. And so we have a tool that also does. Kind of an age banded approach where you're giving a little bit more money to the older people versus the younger people. It's a little more equitable. However, it's not necessary. You can compliantly do either or at your stage of growth. You're not under any major requirements from the ACA until you hit at least 50 employees. So unless you have more than 50, let me know, but I don't think you do. \nmaria:\nNot yet. \nSeth Wood:\nI'm not sure if I'm ready for that headache yet. \nmaria:\nLet's go. \nSeth Wood:\nLet's get you there. Well, I mean, it's always a good thing, but it is, yeah, it's a headache. Yeah, for sure. Especially healthcare. Healthcare can be a major headache. Cool. So let me show you the basic tool first. I think that's the starting point. Let me just give you this one, it's really easy to see kind of what the costs do. And before I share my screen really quick, let me just change this. Anything else besides that today, anyone wanted to pop in on? Is this the most priority for you? I think it's going to be. \nmaria:\nYeah, so, you know, I guess in full transparency. So hopefully maybe you can hit on this point. Because this is for me personally, probably like the biggest and most selfish thing that I'm looking for as an employer. If I'm nothing, if not just very straightforward. I found you guys simply by researching which insurance companies integrate with Quickbooks online. \nSeth Wood:\nHonestly, honestly. \nmaria:\nSo to kind of give you a little backstory to it, you know, we've been, we've been giving. Our employees are wonderful, wonderful employees for benefits now, for well over a decade plus. And, you know, the world's been just very manual for a very long time. And it was probably about a year and a half ago. I just really sort of struggled with our 401k. I just found it to be the most excruciating experience. You know, I like to think that I'm probably, you know, probably the most tech savvy person here. And until we had a director join us who came from a much more advanced company. and, you know, he really kind of complained about the way our benefits were ran. And just opened our eyes up to kind of integration tools. And I found a 401k plan that just seamlessly integrated. Into our QuickBooks. It was just a godsend. And, um, and it, that became more and more apparent every time. I had to manually process our HSA contributions and manually process our, our monthly health insurance payments. And sometimes I'd forget, um, cause it just happens, you get busy and it's not automated. And you'd always ask, can you at least just auto-withdrawal, ACH? Like, just, we know it's approximately this amount. I'm okay. If it, if it changes with a new enrollee, um, just, just take the money out of my account. So no one forgets that I don't have to get that. Nerve wracking letter in the mail going, Oh, If you don't make your payment by the 10th of the month, your policy expires. And every time I would call, they're like, yeah, no, we're not there yet. No, we're not there yet. So, you know, what I'm really looking forward today is just really understanding how well you guys integrate. Cause, when I look on Quickbooks Online's website, that is mentioned as a platform that does integrate nicely with their services. Of course, you can use Quickbooks is partnership that they have with a couple of insurance companies. The other aspect that I'm looking for as well, outside of the Quickbooks integration is how well do you guys translate to non-English speaking members? How well is your platform usable? Because I understand the theory behind your guys' business model is a lot of self-choice, right? So if I have, you know, I have a very high Hispanic speaking population here. And so, while many of them do, of course. Fluently speak English, I think that when it comes to more difficult material like this, having it available in Spanish will be enormously beneficial just to clear the cobwebs. And no one point blame at me for not being transparent. So that's a huge thing that I'm looking for. And then just how well does it work on a mobile device? Because, let's face it, most of my under 30 crowd, they don't, I think, know what a computer is anymore. I think a computer is a little thing in their hand. How well it works from an app is another big question of mine. That I'm going to need to be able to answer to the folks that asked me about this. \nSeth Wood:\nYes. Okay, great question. Three questions in there, I heard. So, first question, how does it work with an app? It's mobile optimized. So we have people that are older who don't have desktops. They can open the enrollment flow on their phone. It'll optimize for their phone. \nmaria:\nAwesome. Both Android and Apple? \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, it's a web-based enrollment. So they have the link, they get an email sent from you for our Hellothatch.com goes into their inbox. They click on the link. It takes them to a place to create a thatch account, so they can create a personal email and then they can walk through that. I enrolled in my healthcare firsthand through Thatch this year and did it on my phone. And so no big deal. I mean, I knew what I was doing a little more, but the tool works. So that's easy. I don't get a lot of negative feedback around that at all. I haven't heard anything from any of our customers. For Spanish, going reverse order, Spanish speaking, definitely a concern and not the first to ask that question at all. We have a lot of groups. I just had a group in California who has a lot of factory line Spanish speakers who are using Thatch. So we have resources and communications that I can share, introducing them to the concept in Spanish. Totally. Awesome. The website we are working on to translate it fully into Spanish. Right now, it is still in English. However, we've run this with groups where they can use just the Google Translate option. It seems to translate it very nicely. We do have plan selection support, too. So, like, if they see the list, there's a help and support button on the bottom. They have the ability to talk to a Spanish speaking licensed advisor as well. So we can support that, too. It's very common. The big gap is just the website. So we're working on building that more. \nmaria:\nThat's amazing. \nSeth Wood:\nOkay. Localization next year is going to be important to us as we're growing. And then QuickBooks. So, yes, QuickBooks, the integration is very straightforward. I have had multiple customers utilize quickbooks with that. It's going to, it will sync your roster, whatever's in your rosters, Your quickbooks is your source of truth that will come into thatch. So, any names and email addresses are eligible. Employees are going to come into your batch account. And then just to show. \nmaria:\nWhen people become eligible, will it alert me too? Because that's something that I forget to do. \nSeth Wood:\nGreat question. Do you have, like, a waiting period? Is that what you're asking? \nmaria:\nYeah, so our current setup is that it is a 90-day probationary period just for the ease of just any turnover that occurs in that time. \nSeth Wood:\nMakes total sense. So today, we don't have an alert system in Thatch. The compliance piece is you have to invite them. Click and invite. You still have to do that. But I know you can set alerts and other. Payroll providers. So maybe possible in QuickBooks, you can just send a reminder or something like that. To set that tone out. Just because it's just not something that we can do. Hopefully in the future, maybe the product will support that more directly and we can take that feedback. We could add it to our Christmas list for next year. \nmaria:\nThat'd be awesome. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, I know. But the roster gets synced into Thatch. Eligible employees. So with the ICRA, you offer this to a class of employees in the entirety. They don't have to accept it. They don't get the funds if they don't accept it. They have to accept health care to get any of the allowance you provide them. But you'd offer it to your full-time hourly, full-time salary, part-time hourly, part-time salary, or by state. That's kind of the I.R.S classifications on who you'd offer it to. So you can offer it to just your full-time employees. You don't have to offer it to everybody legally. But you just decide in that group who you'd want to offer this icra to. And then maybe your whole roster gets pulled into, that's right, but you're only inviting the eligible employees that you need to invite to that. If that makes sense, it does. \nmaria:\nUm, maybe you'll show this to me, but if I understand correctly, just, you know, comparing to other platforms, so that integrate. Um, you know, it's gonna, yeah, I log into thatch, I, I see everybody, and then I'm doing it. Okay, all right, perfect, yeah, all right. \nSeth Wood:\nYou'd see all your employees, it would show you, um, type full-time, this is just a dummy account, but it would show. It'd show a Quickbooks symbol or sign up here, saying Quickbooks sync, and then you'd see all of your list employees. And then you're just going to check the employees and click invite, basically on whoever is eligible in that group. You can filter by the type of employee if you want to do only full-time and then invite the full-time. And you can do that too. But anything you update in Quickbooks will be synced over here. So if you add new employees in QuickBooks, they will come over here and then after 90 days, you would just invite them. Into thatch. And then the other nice piece with the integration is. If you're giving an employee 300 or 400, whatever your budget will be, then the employee can choose a plan that costs more money. You're only paying 400, or they choose a 500 plan. That hundred dollar overage, if they buy up, will get automatically deducted out of your payroll with quickbooks from Thatch. \nmaria:\nSo okay, so, using that example, right now, I contribute, they contribute 25%. So of that 400, are you saying that they would be 25% plus that $100 difference? \nSeth Wood:\nIt would be a dollar amount on the Icra versus a percentage that you're currently doing. \nmaria:\nAnd forgive me, what does Icra stand for? What is that acronym? \nSeth Wood:\nIt's a terrible, terrible acronym. Individual coverage, health reimbursement Arrangement. It's an IRA. It's a type of HRA, excuse me. So it's... Basically, under that umbrella, which allows all those dollars to be pre-tax that you're providing them. So you're giving them a monthly allowance and dollar amount, which will determine, if you did it, what you'd want to do. And then if they pay, if you give them, maybe we decide, because I'm looking at what you're doing today, it's roughly, some people have a little bit more, but it's roughly that $300 to $400 range. You would just determine what's your budget based on the plan options that they have. And then anything above that, they would just pay the difference in payroll deductions every pay period. So it would just be you give them 300 and they choose a plan that's 400. Hundred dollars gets split monthly in between the payroll that you set up with us, if that makes sense. \nmaria:\nIt does. So just and maybe you can show me here maybe an example of one of these dummy employees. So you know, if Alice were to be getting $300 a month from me in in pre-tax dollars? So does she? Every pay period get like an extra 150 on her paycheck? And then you guys automatically are withdrawing that to pay for her health insurance. Like, how do I make sure the debits and credits, um, are not something that they're not paying towards her plan? \nSeth Wood:\nSo you're paying on the payroll end, on the back end, your whatever plan they choose, you're actually going to pay the full amount on the 15th of every month to the carrier through that. So we're paying. \nmaria:\nOK, so my money will go to the carrier direct. \nSeth Wood:\nYou rebuilt the rails. So it should feel exactly like a group plan as much as possible. So you're paying the carriers full amount. Any other bridges, your employees are paying you back by payroll deductions. For any differences. \nmaria:\nAh, I see. Okay. So the money never transfers through their hands to be responsible to pay to the carrier. Thankfully. \nSeth Wood:\nYes. Okay. \nmaria:\nThat was my biggest concern. \nSeth Wood:\nWe don't want that, ideally, never to be that case. There are certain where they might have to put it on a batch card and do a, that's not, reimbursement model is not great for this model. So we do it as seamless as possible, and the deductions will automate for you there, which is really nice. Right. \nmaria:\nAnd so from their visual, when they look at their pay stub, it doesn't look any different. Because they're still getting a deduction of some sort paid out. I see. \nSeth Wood:\nYou might just say on their payroll, I've never seen it and never been asked. So don't ask me how it's going to look. I can't tell you. But they're going to show up on the pay stub like a deduction for that, whatever that amount is. And it is pre-tax as well, which is nice. \nmaria:\nSo got it. Got it. Got it. OK. All right. So you're suggesting to me that I need to come up with some sort of median value that allows for all of this to be possible. \nSeth Wood:\nSo I will show you. Yes. So part of what this is. Let me show you the quoting tool that we that we use. And um, that's why, obviously, we're talking today. But the main reason that is, where did it go? Did I close it out? Of course, I did. Okay, so there's two ways we can do this. You can do the same thing you're doing right now. Just give it a dollar amount. You can also do a little bit of variation. When I did, do like a 75%-ish split for a dynamic. It ranges between 300 and some people who are older getting, you know, $408. So it's not crazy wide. You could probably just still do a flat dollar amount. And most people are going to have pretty much the same. Give me a moment because my link disappeared and my presentation is now suffering because of it. \nmaria:\nYou're good. I'm processing and taking all this in. \nSeth Wood:\nBut yeah, with the ICRA, it's a dollar amount, because the premiums are in dollar amount. But the tool will let you see every employee with the allowance that you've provided them, with the plans that they're going to have as well. So let me just go European Stone tile. Perfect. And then we just double check. Perfect. OK, cool. \nmaria:\nWhile you're multitasking, well, one of the things that we talk about today is your presence and role. Part of it, you know, to help guide me in. Sort of narrowing down perhaps what the plans might be that the employees may want to look at, or how do I operate as a tool of transparency for them so they don't freak out? that, you know, instead of them just being told what they're going to get and figuring out their doctors from that, that they actually have a choice. I mean, I'm deeply concerned about the possibility of them feeling overwhelmed and not like, you know, from 25 to 26, their medical care is going to be a smooth transition. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, that's a great question. And honestly, choices usually deemed as a really positive thing. First of all, people are really excited that they can stay in network with doctors. Because you're dictating the group plan where they're going to go. And the network? And gosh, I can't go to the hospital or I can't see this, especially people that maybe they have our Spanish speakers that they know they trust in their communities. So we're just trying to help that piece. We work with the tool to. Isolate that so they can filter by providers through our tool. They can do that on the front end without talking to anybody. They can compare tools. And yeah, if you have time, I know we have a few minutes, but I can definitely stay over a few. To walk you through a demo if you want to see it. \nmaria:\nI would love that. I mean, honestly, I like to not be confronted with confusion when they ask. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, it's really important to communicate clearly. So, but I'll show you that after the quote real quick. I'll give you a quick rundown of how it would work. But yeah, they would just do that, and then they can jump on a call if they have questions for prescriptions, like things like that. Next year, we're going to be building prescriptions into the tool directly, so they don't have to talk to somebody. But our licensed advisors can help them with additional family planning, surgeries, anything you can imagine that somebody might want additional help on. We can definitely walk them through that, too. So the most people, 85 percent, go through that and don't speak to anybody. The tool is... How long have you done this? We've been around for four years as a company. So this is our fourth open enrollment. We have, well, I mean, we have thousands of customers now. We are, I mean, we deal with this every year. And so a lot of our team is, I mean, we've got small businesses like yourself. We've got businesses that have thousands of employees joining Dash. So it's a variety of business size doing this. So, which is interesting. It's been always small business, really, for this. But it's growing more and more upmarket, which is cool. So, okay, let me show you the tool. It's really easy as far as like what it's doing. This is just the most basic way you could offer an ECRA. And you'll have a copy of this today. I'll send it to you so you can edit things on it if you want. So you can just click on the edit button up here. What do you want to offer your team? So like, that's just 362 is like, kind of what I saw, But you can type in and change it to whatever dollar amount you'd want to offer every person. You have the ability also to offer dependent coverage if you want to. It's up to you. If you guys do that, you can offer an allowance to that piece. \nmaria:\nI'd like to keep the quote Apples to Apples for right now. So I think right now we don't, we as a company don't offer dependent coverage. They can buy it and it's additional. Cool. And then, you know, I didn't see it. Yeah. Raise that to probably, you know, like 390 or 395, because I think that was kind of the running average quotes I was getting. Yeah. When I was looking at other competitors, you can do 395. \nSeth Wood:\nAnd then when you go to view employees, it'll just show everyone getting 395. Like, this is the most simple way to do an ECRA, if you wanted to do it this way, where everyone's just getting the same dollar amount. The cost difference, there's some gaps because you brought on some new people. And so I don't have that data. I don't know what they're paying out of pocket or anything yet. So we're just kind of basing it. \nmaria:\nI wouldn't know either. They're not on the plan now. \nSeth Wood:\nI guess ignore some of that. But when you click on any employee, so just to show you two things, we click on any employee. It does a nice snapshot, quick high-level view, 29 plans available, EPO, HMO, Ambetter, Kaiser, Blue Shield, and United. Age 37 Zero dependence. It's giving you just a quick sneak peek what I do like to do. If you click on these three lines on the tool, it's going to pull up all of their options in a nice list to view. Where you can filter like lowest premium, you could see your contribution. And for this bronze plan, this is like a catastrophic, low level bronze. They'd only pay 56 a month out of pocket total per month if they did this option. Or they can go up, you can filter by silver, and you can see they'd be paying $90 a month with your contribution. Or gold, if they've got, maybe they want a really rich gold, they've got Ambetter, let's say. Do they have a healthcare provider that they've been using that they like? Do you know? \nmaria:\nYes, we have been with Primera Blue Cross, I think. \nSeth Wood:\nBlue Cross? Okay. Yeah. I don't see that offered here. Not on individual. I'd say United. Regents are pretty well known in the group space and here. Ambetter is owned by Centene, and they're only on individual plants. They're really good. They're growing. Kaiser's a cult. People. \nmaria:\nYeah, I'm not a fan. I'm not a fan. I've seen my grandma's health care. It's meh. \nSeth Wood:\nBut people love Kaiser. I came from California and it's a cult. People love it. They'll just love it. It's just a thing. If they want Kaiser, cool. They'll have their kids at Kaiser. That's their thing, right? Yeah. But yeah, they can look at Blue Shield, 310 a month, United, 313 if they want to buy up and get a richer. Otherwise, they have Ambetter and Kaiser as well, HSAs, HMO and EPOs. \nmaria:\nSo say, I'm Alan, and he's clicked on this screen and he's here, hops on a call with one of your consultants and asks a question such as, you know, I'm, I'm with. With Primera Blue Cross right now, and I love my network. Because I can go to such and such hospitals, what is going to allow me to stay with either A, the same doctor or same facility, and what is the most comparable? Are those questions that they can just say, yeah, this insurance company is the same, or how does that work? \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, exactly. So they can search the provider network within thatch without talking to that person. They can filter. I'll show you in the demo. But if they have specific questions about Like... Where can I make sure that what plans are going to keep me in network and what plans are going to be? This is what I'm on today. This is why I'm on it today. Can we get me something similar to that, where I can be in network and also manage my costs? This is how much I want to pay out of pocket. The more complicated the question is, that's where the licensed broker advisor will help them out. They'll walk them through their license in their state specifically. So they're going to be able to walk them through that information. That's, that's kind of where they shine, for sure. Most people will know without talking, to be fair, from the data points we see, but specifically if they have special needs, always definitely reach out and talk to our team. We'd always recommend that so they can definitely be steered in the right direction. The other nice piece of the ICRA, and it's something that would add a little complication, not bad, they would just cancel their plan and do something else. Within ICRA, you have 60 days to change your plan. So if they decide on a plan and they want to switch the plan next year, they could do it early again next year, before February and use a different plan for February 1st. If they weren't, they made a mistake or they decided differently. That's again, they'd have to call, cancel with carrier, do a couple of steps. But the Icra does allow that flexibility, too, which is nice. \nmaria:\nSo, from the beginning of the year. Anytime in the year. \nSeth Wood:\nSo it's a 60 day. When you offer the ICRA, an employee has 60 days to select a plan total. On the back end, you could, you'll set your enrollment for a one one, it would be. We have to move faster than that, for sure. But to guarantee them that one one, But for the, if they want to switch a plan within the first 60 days, they can do that, it'll just start whenever it would align with the carrier for the following months, basically. But that's something just we don't ideally want, because they'd have to call the carrier and do a couple of things. But if they did make a mistake, our team can help them with that, walk them through the steps. \nmaria:\nI see. Okay. \nSeth Wood:\nWell, let's not make too much noise about that option. I wouldn't hear that, but it's good to know. Yeah. They're not stuck if they did something wrong. We can help them out. But yeah, they would check those options. And I'll show you the demo here in a second. But very, very straightforward. So you would just see all the employees are getting $395 or whatever you decide. And then the employee contribution is, just so you can see the totals, we don't know what they're going to choose and select. It's a little bit of a vague number here. I don't know where it's getting this cost from, to be fair with you. This is just, we don't know the plan they're going to choose. So I assume it's grabbing from, like, a comparison in somewhere, but I wouldn't go by this. I would just go by, you know, basically, do you know what kind of plan they're on today? Like the deductible out of pocket, is it vary between the employee? \nmaria:\nNo, it's a singular unified group plan that's the same across all age bands in terms of the services of the plan. The only thing that distinguishes is, of course, is that the rate of cost changes with their age. So I think at present we're at a $5,000 or $5,500 deductible. It's somewhere in that range, $5,000 to $6,000 deductible for individual. And then, um, like 11 to 12 000 deductible for family plans I, and it is an HSA plan right now. \nSeth Wood:\nOkay, I would say it's probably equivalent, from what I know in the individual plans to a low level silver plan. Or maybe a high, high percentile bronze, which just means like, a richer bronze, because that deductible is fairly high, probably up silver. I'm gonna, I'm gonna go with that end of things, just meaning it's, yeah, that makes about sense. \nmaria:\nI know we definitely couldn't afford the gold, Yeah. And they only offer with the group that we're with, the organization that gives us our choice presently and has for the last 10 years. In every category, whether that be a HSA, an HMO, a standard plan, they only ever offer three tiers per category. And I always know that I go with right in the middle. I never go the lowest and I never go the most expensive. I always choose Plan B. And so we've been with an HSA option, probably now, for the better part of three or four years. And we've always just gone plan B in an HSA route. But this year, unfortunately, I think no one really, myself included, kind of took advantage of the HSA feature. Because the whole interface, just from an employer and also an employee user, it was such a mess that no one benefited from it. So it was really just kind of a wholehearted, wasted choice. \nSeth Wood:\nThat's a bummer. Yeah, that's the thing is like, it's got to be intuitive and easy to use. And if not, it's going to get unused. So there are HSA options. So they will have the ability to do that if they want to do that. We don't administer HSA accounts yet. It's on my Christmas list for next year, hopefully, because we get that asked a lot. But because it's HRA, HSA are different tools. So they could still choose an HSA option. If they want a high deductible health plan, it's totally fine. It would just you'd be paying the premium for that plan. And then the employee would, either, if you're continuing with the vendor, have that under your umbrella. Or the employee would just get their own, like go to Fidelity or somebody that they want and get an account. Because the account is theirs. That's the advantage of an HSA. It's their account. They can do whatever they want with it. So just be aware, like whatever direction they want it. If you think HSAS are still going to be very popular, then they still have choice there. But they also have a lot more than HSA if they're looking for. Alternatives that also, to be fair, are going to be, you know, similar in price and everything else. \nmaria:\nUm, okay, so they would have to, uh, self-administer, uh, the the plan. \nSeth Wood:\nIf you're not, yeah, if you're not offering. Sometimes, um, and I can't speak in generalities, but sometimes these carriers include, I had one carrier through another carrier does include an HSA account. Somehow. I don't know how that happens, but I can't promise you that's the case with any of these. \nmaria:\nNo, that's perfectly fine. The individual who I know complained the most was also most unhappy because they had a lot of difficulties rolling over from... The insurance companies required use of administrative banking, if that's the right word. I don't even really know. And then to roll it from there to their private, self-administered plan, it was really sort of a nightmare. \nSeth Wood:\nI think it's their way of just keeping you in their carrier. \nmaria:\nAnd getting their fees. There's a lot of fees. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, there are other ways to make money. I get it. I get it. Yeah. No, HSAs are ideal for those people if they want to keep them. And then it's got a triple tax advantage. You know, they know what they're doing if they got an HSA. They can keep it for a long time. But all that to say, so they have choice and you can adjust that. But just as far as the fees go, high level, you know, the employer contribution is pretty simple. It's $3.95 times any employee that enrolls. So whoever enrolls, you can uncheck it and see the totals change based on who enrolls. And then the Thatch platform fees. To administer so we handle, you'll see in the demo what we do, but we handle it all, including your administration piece, all the back end, the technology. Um, you don't need Cobra yet, probably, but we do cobra at some point. As well as the 1095 forms, we do the compliance pieces, everything, and we do the advisory, take care of the support, just like we're doing it all. Is that a. \nmaria:\nIs that a monthly fee? \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, so we. It's for an administration third-party administration fee 45 dollars per employee that enrolls per month. So whatever employee enrolls in, thatch per month, and then a once a month $50 flat rate just to the business for compliance, basically. So if five employees enroll, that's the fee, if 10, but it's really about whoever enrolls in the platform. \nmaria:\nSo it's more along the lines, about $500. Five dollars, let's just say five hundred dollars a month, to keep the math congruent, and so it's about six grand a year. Just for the services of working with Thatch. \nSeth Wood:\n455, yeah is what I see here, so yeah, 455 would be all these employees, nine employees, um, a month, including the fees. Yeah, so yeah, if, if. In that to administer the HRA, the Icra pre-tax, the integration, like it's, it's. It's not an easy job, of course. But it's simple enough when you do it through us, because they're not having to go through that. And so the total up here would be if everyone enrolled, if every single person in this list enrolls in health care, It's that $4,000 a month cost, including your $395, plus the batteries and everything else. \nmaria:\nAnd then you guys are proposing that the plan is roughly about $400, or $4,900. \nSeth Wood:\nA year, 4900, a year, or the annual here you can see, too. \nmaria:\nSo yeah. The cost between going with the average quotes that I've been running with versus what you guys are proposing is roughly, um, that six thousand dollar. Delta, the cost of service that you guys provide. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, there's, there's different vendors and different. Like. I would say. I won't speak negatively, but I'll tell you that I've heard. Costs from 20 pepm to 100 pepM out in the marketplace for other vendors. What does PEPM mean? \nmaria:\nI've never heard that word. \nSeth Wood:\nPer employee that enrolls per month. \nmaria:\nYou are full of acronyms today. It's fun. \nSeth Wood:\nIt's fun to say. PEPM, PEPM. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a PEPM. PEPM is usually the way it's done. So we do everything in-house, but on top of it, the product is really good. We're from Stripe, Ramp, Rex. We haven't had a delinquency in four years ever on thatch and billing and payments. And so some of our, I've heard we've had people moving from other vendors to Thatch this year. A lot of our customers, some of them came over from other vendors for different reasons, but a lot of it is product related. A lot of it is still issues with payments, issues with having the employee get reimbursed, having to deal with that model. We don't do that. And so definitely, the product is, I think the last renter of the ICHRA, it seems to be Thatch. really. And I can compare us to others. Now, that said, like, you know, I think there are people that could do a great job for you too, for sure. But it would definitely, it comes down to the experience for an administrator and the employee and just making sure it runs well. And we spent a lot of time on our infrastructure when we started. We didn't try to sell it. We were just trying to, like, figure out and fix the problem with data, with science and data science, and understand how is this going to work? And how can we make it feel like the best system that people have had. And so. If you are, like, keen on thatch, if you're, this is the direction. If you want to go, I would only say that, like, definitely let me know. Like, I'm happy to have a conversation and see what I can do to help. It's not a big deal to me. And it's just more about making sure you'd want to be doing it with us and be happy here. But then. \nmaria:\nNo, I appreciate that. How was my question? Just kind of left me for a second there. How can I see the plan cost? Kind of like the way you just demoed out for that first Alan example? \nSeth Wood:\nYeah. \nmaria:\nAfter we get off this call, do I get an opportunity to kind of go in and look at all the carriers and their rates based off the data? \nSeth Wood:\nYou're going to have this tool. I'm going to send this to you. We built this. I see. So you'll click on, you can click and do a high-level snapshot, and then do a little filtering. Or, you can click on these three lines and get that full list. View like this and really dive in and see what their highest premium would be for them versus lowest. You can really get a sense. \nmaria:\nYou can also. \nSeth Wood:\nIf you want, I can send you a public facing tool. You can share with the employees too, to look at, to see their options. \nmaria:\nI'm running out of time. \nSeth Wood:\nOkay. So, yeah, when is your, let's talk about the deadlines. It's pretty important. \nmaria:\nLike, 24 hours is all I'm giving myself to make a decision. \nSeth Wood:\nOkay. Okay. So we, so we can do this quickly. It takes 10 minutes, 15 minutes to set up a batch account for admin. It's if your bank needs to be verified. manually. Sometimes it can take one to three business days at the max. It can be same day, though. It's just to set expectations. Our standard cutoff for enrollment for one one standard is on the 22nd on Monday for an employee to choose a plan. OK, before Christmas, if we do need to talk to our team and get an extension, we might be able to get you, I think, till the 28th. That's probably doable for us. \nmaria:\nYeah, I don't think having people choose a plan by Monday would be of any consequence or issue. Because I would just plan on pulling each employee in and sitting them down and making them do it. Um, all by Friday. Um, brutal, just because I know there's, oh, I just know, there's so many questions and I know who I can group and have a group meeting with. Versus those I need to sit down and handhold a little bit more, because if they don't do it with my presence, they're they're just not going to do it. \nSeth Wood:\nNo, totally, that's fair, that's totally fair. Um, yeah, so yeah, that's not an issue. I mean, timelines, we still have time. It's just making sure, you know, like, the hardest part of this model is always the allowance. What do you want to offer? What does this get, everyone? For you and your levels, it's pretty decent. Like, you have flexibility. People are not getting, I think the Delta, the reason I would go with, oh, sorry, this is the more complicated. The reason I would go with this is because I don't see a huge value to give a little bit more to someone else. If they're all kind of in the same price point. Sometimes it's double cost for a premium. And then we really want to look at making it fair for people. But when I did the analysis the other way, it didn't seem too much higher. So I would just say, probably keep it simple because your timeline is short. It's going to add more time to look at the other path, in my opinion. And if you wanted to readdress it, if you did move forward next year, you can always readdress how you're doing your allowance again. \nmaria:\nNo, absolutely. I guess based off the time that you've been working in the position, in the role that you have been doing this. It sounds like, from what you're saying, a succinct monthly allowance is, you know, following the kiss rule, keep it simple. And how have you, however, seen in a area or a state, I don't know how much territory you do coverage on, but how have you guided employers to sort of discern that amount? with, I'm sure, one pillar being, you know, last year's or this current year's premiums they've been paying. But I mean, obviously, costs have all risen for 2026. So how do you guide someone like myself to make this consideration? \nSeth Wood:\nGreat question. And it's a hard one to answer. But I always say to keep it simple. What is your budget? Start there. Like, I would just say, what do you want to contribute, ideally, per month? You want to keep, you want to keep it the same as last year's, which is that 360, I imagine, or try to start three and eight, whatever you want to do. And then look at the employees. I think what this model allows for is flexibility. Your goal should be to offer people enough to get maybe a mid-level plan, right? So you're at least giving them enough to, comparably out of their salary, pay for easily a mid-level plan, like a silver, or like, maybe even a bronze. You could look at it that way. Whatever you think is your base level, you want to cover a good amount of that. And then give them the freedom and flexibility to buy up or buy down. Like, that's the whole purpose of a NICRA. So they can choose what's best for them. And you're not over insuring people with your your costs by paying too much money. And the sweet spot really for you is, I would just look at, Hey, maybe what are you doing today? Would you be okay? If you paid that same amount to every employee next year, is that going to be good for you? Be a little selfish there. But knowing when you use our tool, you can see the impacts for that dollar amount to the employee. And it's probably not going to be based on the numbers. I'm saying, terrible, either way. So you have a lot of flexibility if you want to do more or less up to you. But I would just start there for your budget and see what that does for individuals. I think it's going to be pretty good. \nmaria:\nSo, and then I think one of the probably last questions is more so when you do see those expanded details. For the carriers and their rates and all of that wonderful information that's provided in that summary overview. Um, if somebody wanted to drill down and see, like the plan details feature of it, does it? Um, give them a lot of of insights. Or, to your point, I think you said earlier they would have to call one of the licensed brokers. But I think you kept saying, there's some sort of like chat feature, is it an AI chat? \nSeth Wood:\nLet me show you, yeah, if you have a second, I don't want to waste all the time. \nmaria:\nNo, I want to know as much as possible while I have your attention. I know you're busy. \nSeth Wood:\nYou got my attention. We're good. No, no, you're good. I've been doing more with just follow-ups. Actually, it's been, you know, it's getting a little slower, not slow, but in the years coming. So I have a little more time right now. So let's say you're going to send the invite to your team through Thatch. They get an email sent to them from personal email, whatever emails and quickbooks goes out to them. And then they would get a link, or you'd, you know, have them, I would share with you, probably if you're doing a sit down with them, if you wanted to do that mechanism, they would still need to send the invites to them. \nmaria:\nBut it's also available in an app. Is that what it is? Like, it's in the play Store. It's an app. \nSeth Wood:\nNo app. No, it's just on the Web. So they're going to get. \nmaria:\nOh, so it really has been formatted from a web browser to a mobile view. OK. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah. Yeah. So it's no issue there. So, but you can also do a link. I can give you, like, a placeholder link where they type the email address and if it's on a laptop that you sent them the invite to. And they can start this process that you're seeing on your screen from there, too. Otherwise, they can just do it on their phone, or do it at home, or whatever they want. Just FYI, but they just click that link. It gives them a little welcome to Thatch. You could add the Google Translate. It'd start to translate if they're Spanish speaking. They just create a thatch account. They can put whatever email address they want to, not just the one you sent them there. If they have a personal, they create or log in under pressure to get the email, get the passwords right on the same time here. Great. Okay. I always mistype. The only things that we ask are just the, you know, the address and the date of birth. So we can get the right plans wherever they live in the rating area. So they're going to enter that and then they're going to see their allowance for the very first time. So they'd see this $395, $350, whatever your amount is here. Medical is going to show dental vision are optional. You don't have to go through thatch for that at all. If you already have that, just FYI. \nmaria:\nNo, we would need to. So I'm glad you brought that up. So our current solutions provider is an all-inclusive bundle in what they have me choose. So there's the bill that I gave you. And then additionally, the employees pay for the dental and the vision, but the rates are really cheap. Okay. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah. Dental vision rates are not as chaotic as healthcare. And usually you're going to see competitiveness anywhere you go. But with that, we have Guardian and Renaissance. So we would just turn that on. And then, after they select the medical plan, then they would see the options to do a role in dental and vision separately. And so. \nmaria:\nCan you show me what that looks like, too? So I understand. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, yeah. It's included today. So you'll see how that would work. But. They would add dependents. If they have a dependent, they can click Add dependent. You're not offering anything for dependents as discussed, but they would just do that so we can update the plans for them with the costs. They can also decline coverage if they don't want to move forward. \nmaria:\nAre they required to decline formally if they don't want it? No. \nSeth Wood:\nNo, no. Usually after 60 days, it'll just auto decline because that's cut off. So they hit next. And then one or two more pieces of information. That we in carriers would want to know tobacco use things like that. See available plans. So on the top, right? It's going to show the allowance that you're providing them. Kind of like a checking cart, checkout cart, so they can see. And then we try to help them filter the plans, starting with this little bar on the top, how often do you expect to use your insurance? That's a little, yeah, whatever, let me run the demo the way I want to run it. I'm just kidding. Oh, sorry. Go for it. \nmaria:\nGo ahead. \nSeth Wood:\nNo, you're good. \nmaria:\nI'm just thinking of my Superman syndrome, young boys. \nSeth Wood:\nLet's do it. Yeah, a little. Yeah, yeah. I'm just teasing you. So how much do you want to pay out of pocket? Do they want nothing? Or do they want, like, well, can they pay out of pocket? So maybe $850 a month is the max I want to take out of my... Payroll and providers. So we can filter by doctors, right, so they can type Thomas in there. And then I'm filtering this down to 38 plans now. \nmaria:\nOh my God, how many would there be? \nSeth Wood:\nHoly Moly 40, I'm gonna go let's do someone, often 27. So we're knocking the plans down a little bit more, uh, metal tier, insurance company plan type. What we do, though, we stack rank the top two plans for them. So they see like, what's the most comprehensive, what's the lowest cost? To me, which is these Kaiser's? Because this is California. If they click View details, you're used to seeing the summary of benefits, this document right here. We take that information and we neatly present it and clean it up. \nmaria:\nI see. Yeah. I'm familiar with that PDF. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah. It's terrible, but they can click on three plans at the same time and compare, cross compare. I'll just do two here. They can see between them the differences if they're trying to zoom in. On what works best for them. If they have more questions, and again, the data shows, 85%, 80% don't talk to anybody. They just go through this. We have a chat bot. They can ask basic questions to things like, What is an EPO? It's a PPO. It's a, if they want to understand deductibles, things like that, like, what is an EPO? Or maybe I've never seen that network before. \nmaria:\nSo I like how it says this is an AI generated reply. So would a the actual licensed broker be able to see this? This chat is that shared? \nSeth Wood:\nUh, no, the chat is not shared. From my understanding, I don't know the answer, I don't believe there's any connection there. \nmaria:\nSo they kind of start the Q A over if they, if they wanted to, yeah, and so here's why. \nSeth Wood:\nSo they could get that, but they would click on help and support. I need help deciding between plans. \nmaria:\nI see, book a call. \nSeth Wood:\nWe want to schedule a call with them to talk to them so we can walk them through that. And so we have time all day long. It launches a calendar here, of course. There we go. So what is it? It's Tuesday, Central time. We have time still all day here central till 8.40 over the weekend too, starting at 7 a.m. Every 10 minutes, starting tomorrow, all the way to 8.40 p.m. Central and on the weekend. So they can get tons of time. \nmaria:\nAnd this is available throughout the year? Just keep us in the question about the plan that they've committed to. \nSeth Wood:\nFor, yeah, for enrollment. So specifically for enrollment, this is the best way to do this. We could connect them with an advisor after enrollment because they wouldn't have the ability to book a call directly. This is made for enrollment specific scenario. \nmaria:\nAh, okay. \nSeth Wood:\nIf they have issues after enrollment, we have support still. So our support at Thatch.com team would step in and help with anything. I mean, personally, I enrolled in a plan and I submitted it weeks before it should have started. And the carrier failed to process it on their end, even though Thatch provided it. So our Thatch team stepped in and worked on my behalf to get it back dated for me and fixed it. So carriers are old-fashioned, carriers are going to be carriers, but Thatch is the broker of record, so got it okay. They can reach out to them, but that's what they would do, and then they would just click Choose a plan. Let's say, I'm going to go with, um, this one, this is an HMO, um, let's do. I don't know why child dental shows, but then they would show dental insurance, they would see something like this wherever they live. They would show both of these options, so they could select a dental or vision option. Um, I'm gonna skip it today for the demo, but they would just click Select a plan. \nmaria:\nWhat does like 266.90 per month remaining? Refer to? \nSeth Wood:\nWe're giving an employee 750 in the demo. \nmaria:\nOh, that's right. Okay. All right. And the plan was less than I see. \nSeth Wood:\nIf I did go back and choose a more expensive option and it would show me a negative or a red overage, that's what I see deducted out of my payroll. So they'd understand what's coming out. \nmaria:\nOkay. That makes sense. \nSeth Wood:\nBut good, good question. So they'd see their dental, and then their vision would be, usually it's VSP or Blue Cross sometimes, but VSP covers them. They just choose what option worked best. They could skip it, too, if they don't want dental vision. And then they just finish their social. And then the carrier has a digital. \nmaria:\nCareful, I can see your social security number, Francisco. \nSeth Wood:\nBe careful. Watch out. Always, always, always clear your cookies. Enroll. And then the process gets started. What usually will happen here is they'll be notified. So, like, they're going to, if we did allow an overage of those dollars, which they may or may not have, to be honest, depends on the plan they choose with your. If you did want to allow them to have leftover dollars, you can, so they can use it on qualified medical expenses. Or you can just say it's going to be used only towards the premium. Really, it's up to you. You can ignore payment reminders because as long as you're employed, that's just going to pay the premiums. Sometimes, for some reason, these carriers just still send billing reminders, just so you know, there's nothing we can do about that. So they just need to know, ignore the payments. You're good. And we remind them of this again after the screen, so they don't come back and go, what's going on? Then they go to the dashboard here. And so they've got this neat dashboard view. Again, they have the checklist. They can track their enrollment received, submitted and enrolled. And then they also again, if there's any leftover dollars, if that's something, they have, 50 bucks a month, 30 bucks a month, Depending upon your allowance, they can use this on qualified medical expenses through their Fatch debit card, copays, prescriptions. But we also have a bunch of partnerships for dollars that they can utilize and spend. \nmaria:\nAnd it's use it or lose it by the end of the year, right? Like, in theory, let's just say they have this generous balance, but it's a use it or lose it program, right? \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, it's kind of like an FSA. So it resets in January and it starts over throughout the year again. So it builds up. Yep. So, but that's optional, and that's about it. And then anything else, support at thatch.com after this, if it problems or anything pops up. \nmaria:\nVery impressive. Oh, goodness. This is well, this is very much what I am looking for. This is how I like to treat my employees. So I would love that link. I'd love that demo. I need to sit down with my partner and kind of chat with him about all of this. But like I said, we're looking to aggressively solidify our decision because I already have all my other quotes and numbers. And so this is just kind of the last piece of review. \nSeth Wood:\nOK, perfect. Yeah. Let me give you the quote. Resources, everything I got, I'll just send it over if and just keep us in the loop. Any questions? Um, anything I can do. We can touch this time tomorrow on the on the economics. Keep me in the loop, too happy to help any way I can does not hurt me. I want to make sure it makes sense for you guys on paper, so just just keep keep me, keep me chatting, and then, yeah, reach out. If you want to move forward, we just next steps. I'd probably just get you get your account started asap and then I have an order for them, But we can do that concurrently. I just want to make sure you can get things moving for bank verifications, and then we can get your team enrolled by Monday. \nmaria:\nThe last item would be when you email me, if your company happens to have a link on the website, if it's there, or if it's a separate PDF document for how the QuickBooks integration setup would be done, I'd like info on that. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, for sure. I will send you that when you're setting up your Thatch account, it'll ask you who your payroll provider, it'll help you with that. \nmaria:\nAs the admin. It's asking you as the admin. Okay. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, you'll get that, but I will send you the help articles that we have on it, too. So it's super, super straightforward. But yeah, I will, again, I'll give you everything I got. I'll give you all the information. So you can just have a field day today if you want to. And then take a break next week, hopefully, because it's a lot to deal with. That is the upward goal. \nmaria:\nSeth, thank you for how expeditious you've been on. Just responding to my email and hopping on the call this morning and all your time to answer my questions. It's actually been very, very clear. So thank you. Very well done. Appreciate your time. \nSeth Wood:\nNo, I appreciate you staying in touch. I know it's been a long time. So we'll get it. If this makes sense, we'll be happy to help you guys out. But have a great rest of your week either way, okay? \nmaria:\nYou too. Take care. Bye-bye. \nSeth Wood:\nBye. \n",

J&H Reptile Mythology (Primary discussion)\n   - Current Setup: Small group HMO plan, $1,500 deductible, $6,250 out-of-pocket max; paying $7,309/month (2026 rates); ~$333/employee allowance (50/50 split)\n   - Status: Applicable Large Employer (ALE, 50+ FTEs); California-based\n   \n2. 4-Life Group (Secondary discussion)\n   - Current Setup: No active plan; previously had ICHRA with Take Command (dropped ~1 year ago); currently contributes 75%/70% of Kaiser rates\n   - Demographics: Ages late 40s to 60\n\nPain Points/Challenges:\n- ICHRA dynamic range quote shows higher costs for J&H ($9,269/month vs current $7,309/month)\n- Flat dollar ICHRA option ($333/employee) yields similar costs ($7,326/month pre-fees) with no clear advantage\n- Confusion about dynamic range methodology (age-banded contributions) vs flat dollar approach\n- ALE compliance concerns regarding affordability requirements (9.96% household income rule)\n- Missing salary data needed for accurate compliance calculations\n- 4-life group uncertain if they need to restart ICHRA on 1/1 or can start mid-year\n\nPriorities/Optimization Goals:\n- Understanding ICHRA mechanics and contribution models\n- Finding cost-effective alternatives to current group plans\n- Ensuring ALE compliance\n- Simplifying employee communication about allowances\n\nStated Timelines:\n- J&H Reptile: No immediate timeline; exploring options for current year\n- 4-Life Group: Target 2026-02-01 start date\n- Standard enrollment cutoff: 22nd of month (extension to 28th possible)\n- Employees need ~2 weeks to select plans after enrollment opens\n\nOutcome: J&H Reptile does not appear to be a strong ICHRA fit at current pricing; no cost savings identified."

After detailed analysis, the ICHRA solution does not present a clear cost advantage over their current group plan arrangement.\n\nKey Discussion Points\n\nCurrent Situation:\n- Employer currently offers HMO deductible plan: $1,500 deductible, $6,250 out-of-pocket maximum\n- Current contribution structure: Flat $332-333 per employee per month (50/50 split)\n- 2026 monthly cost: $7,309\n- Company is an Applicable Large Employer (ALE) - over 50 full-time equivalents\n- Located in California\n\nICHRA Pricing Models Discussed:\n\n1. Dynamic/Age-Banded Approach (Recommended by Thatch):\n   - Allowances range from $354 to $738 based on employee age\n   - Benchmarked against 25th percentile gold plan (equivalent to current $1,500 deductible plan)\n   - 50% employer cost share maintained\n   - Estimated monthly cost: $9,269 (approximately $1,960/month increase)\n   - More equitable for older employees whose individual market premiums are higher\n   - Compliant with IRS ICHRA regulations (allowances must increase with age, cannot exceed 3:1 ratio)\n\n2. Flat Dollar Approach:\n   - $333 per employee per month (matching current structure)\n   - Estimated monthly cost: $7,326 pre-fees\n   - Essentially cost-neutral compared to current arrangement\n   - Simpler to administer but less equitable for older employees\n\nCompliance Issues Identified:\n- Red flags in system due to missing salary information\n- ALE affordability requirement: Employees cannot pay more than 9.96% of household income for lowest-level Silver plan\n- System currently using poverty level as default (needs updating with actual salary data)\n\nCost Analysis Conclusion:\n- No significant cost advantage for ICHRA versus current group plan\n- Dynamic model increases costs by ~$1,960/month\n- Flat dollar model essentially cost-neutral (~$17/month difference pre-fees)\n- Standard PEPM fee: $30 per enrolled employee per month\n\nEducational Points Covered:\n- Individual marketplace plans priced by age and location (similar to auto insurance model)\n- ICHRA allows age-based contribution increases (compliant under IRS rules)\n- Cannot do age-based contributions with traditional small group plans\n- ICHRA managed by IRS with clear black-and-white guidelines\n- Plans sourced off-exchange directly from carriers (not through Covered California exchange)\n\nACCOUNT 2: UNNAMED 4-LIFE GROUP\n\nBrief Overview\n- 4 employees, California-based\n- Current contribution: 75% of Kaiser premium (percentage-based)\n- Age range: Late 40s to 60 years old\n- Quote previously provided by Joe (Thatch team member)\n\nDiscussion Points:\n- Cannot do percentage-based contributions with ICHRA (dollar amounts only)\n- Recommendation: Convert current 75% contribution to flat dollar amount\n- Given small group size and same zip code, flat dollar approach recommended for simplicity\n- Potential 2-1-2026 effective date discussed\n\nOpen Question:\n- Employer previously had ICHRA with Take Command, dropped it a year ago\n- Uncertainty about whether they need to restart on 1-1 or can start mid-year\n- Seth's opinion: If no current plan in place, start date shouldn't matter (needs verification)\n\nSTAKEHOLDER IDENTIFICATION\n\nThatch (ICHRA Provider):\n- Seth Wood - Account Executive/Sales Representative\n  - Role: Primary contact, product education, quoting, compliance guidance\n  - Responsibilities: Quote generation, demo presentations, technical support\n  - Email contact provided for follow-up questions\n\n- Joe - Team Member (mentioned)\n  - Role: Handled initial quote for 4-life group\n  - Can assist with enrollment deadline extensions\n\nOne Digital (Broker/Benefits Consultant):\n- Jeff Lue - Benefits Consultant/Broker\n  - Role: Client relationship manager, benefits advisor\n  - Responsibilities: Presenting options to employer clients, coordinating with vendors\n  - Previous experience with Take Command (Thatch competitor)\n\nEmployer Groups:\n- J&H Reptile Mythology - Primary prospect (decision-maker not on call)\n- Unnamed 4-Life Group - Secondary prospect (decision-maker not on call)\n\nCRITICAL MILESTONES & TIMESTAMPS\n\nDecember 16, 2025 (Call Date):\n- Initial quote review and education session conducted\n- Compliance gaps identified (missing salary data)\n- Cost comparison completed showing no advantage for J&H Reptile Mythology\n\nKey Enrollment Deadlines Discussed:\n\nFor 1-1-2026 Effective Date:\n- Standard enrollment cutoff: December 22, 2025 (Monday) - 6 DAYS FROM CALL\n- Possible extension: December 28, 2025 - 12 DAYS FROM CALL\n- Admin account setup: 10 minutes\n- Bank verification: 2-3 days (potential bottleneck)\n- Note: Larger groups already in pipeline for 1-1-2026 start\n\nFor 2-1-2026 Effective Date:\n- Recommended for 4-life group\n- Would allow 2+ weeks for employee plan selection (standard timeline)\n- More realistic timeline given current date\n\nHistorical Context:\n- J&H Reptile Mythology 2026 rates already received and quoted\n- 4-life group previously had ICHRA with Take Command, discontinued ~1 year ago\n\nCOMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE\n\nThatch vs. Take Command:\n- Thatch: All-in-one platform, in-house administration\n- Take Command: Uses multiple vendors, less tech-forward\n- Thatch advantages highlighted:\n  - Single platform for all functions (enrollment, COBRA, filings, payments)\n  - Off-exchange enrollment (90% of cases, except NY and some states)\n  - Automated 1095 and ACA filings included\n  - Thatch debit card for unqualified medical expenses\n  - Batch dashboard for employer administration\n  - Zero delinquencies in 4 years\n  - Built by FinTech team (Stripe, Ramp background)\n  - Many Take Command customers switching to Thatch in 2025\n\nResources Provided:\n- Thatch.com/plans - Plan comparison tool (can be used for any prospective group)\n- Employee-specific plan views available in quoting tool\n- Onboarding videos and resources to be sent\n\nNEXT STEPS & ACTION ITEMS\n\nImmediate Actions (Seth Wood - Thatch):\n- [ ] COMPLETED DURING CALL: Provide education on dynamic vs. flat dollar ICHRA models\n- [ ] PENDING: Send flat dollar quote ($333/employee) for J&H Reptile Mythology\n- [ ] PENDING: Send onboarding resources and video materials to Jeff\n- [ ] PENDING: Send thatch.com/plans link for future reference\n- [ ] IF REQUESTED: Rerun J&H quote with actual salary information (currently using poverty level default)\n\nJeff Lue (One Digital) - Action Items:\n- [ ] PRIORITY: Share both quotes (dynamic and flat dollar) with J&H Reptile Mythology\n- [ ] PRIORITY: Obtain salary information for lowest-paid eligible employee at J&H (if pursuing ICHRA)\n- [ ] DEADLINE: December 22, 2025: Confirm if J&H wants to proceed for 1-1-2026 (or request extension to 12-28-2025)\n- [ ] FOR 4-LIFE GROUP: Verify whether mid-year start is permissible given previous ICHRA history\n- [ ] FOR 4-LIFE GROUP: Calculate current 75% Kaiser contribution in flat dollar amounts\n- [ ] FOR 4-LIFE GROUP: Target 2-1-2026 effective date\n- [ ] Review onboarding materials from Seth\n\nCollaborative Next Steps:\n- [ ] IF INTEREST CONTINUES: Schedule demo call with employer (Seth/Joe to present, Jeff to facilitate)\n- [ ] IF PURSUING: Coordinate on timeline - 1-1-2026 (aggressive) vs. 2-1-2026 (recommended)\n- [ ] ONGOING: Jeff to use Seth as ICHRA resource; Seth to use Jeff as group plan resource\n\nDecision Points:\n- J&H Reptile Mythology: Likely NOT moving forward due to lack of cost savings\n  - No advantage over current group plan\n  - Would need significant rate increase on group side to make ICHRA attractive\n  \n- 4-Life Group: Potentially viable for 2-1-2026\n  - Pending verification of restart requirements\n  - Needs conversion of percentage to dollar contribution\n  - Age variance (late 40s to 60) may benefit from dynamic model\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES\n\nTechnical Learning Points for Jeff:\n- ICHRA contributions must be in dollar amounts (not percentages)\n- Age-banded contributions are IRS-compliant for ICHRA but not traditional group plans\n- Dynamic model uses percentile benchmarking (e.g., 25th percentile gold plan)\n- System calculates affordability based on lowest-level Silver plan in employee's area\n- Employer can adjust cost-share percentage and percentile benchmark as desired\n\nOutstanding Questions:\n1. Can 4-life group start mid-year given previous ICHRA termination? (Needs research)\n2. What are actual salary ranges for J&H employees? (Affects compliance calculations)\n3. Will J&H's 2027 group rates make ICHRA more competitive? (Future consideration)\n\nRelationship Status:\n- First formal meeting between Seth and Jeff\n- Established mutual expertise areas (Seth: ICHRA, Jeff: Group plans)\n- Open communication channel for future opportunities\n- Jeff has direct email access to Seth for questions\n\nRECOMMENDATION SUMMARY\n\nJ&H Reptile Mythology: Not recommended to pursue at this time. Cost-neutral at best, with potential for increased costs under dynamic model. No administrative or financial advantage over current group arrangement. Revisit if 2027 group renewal shows significant increases.\n\n4-Life Group: Potentially viable for 2-1-2026 pending resolution of restart question and conversion of contribution structure to flat dollar amounts. Age variance in group may benefit from ICHRA's individual market pricing."

I've had issues with my audio, so if it doesn't work, let me know. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, no worries, no worries. It's always a feat with tech getting connected to people on different platforms and different places in the country. It's kind of a marvel. It is. \nJeff Lue:\nYeah, let me know, because I get feedback from people that say, I can't hear you. It sounds like it's chopping up or fading out. \nSeth Wood:\nOkay, yeah, no worries. And if we need it, we can... Jump on an old-fashioned phone call, too, I suppose. \nJeff Lue:\nYeah, or I can dial it into or switch to my phone, do it that way, but just let me know. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, no worries, you sound decent. It's not the greatest, not the worst, but I can hear you fine and that's that works for me, so. \nJeff Lue:\nOkay, perfect. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, nice to meet you officially. Yeah, like, I'm happy to. I think I'm not surprised. We're chatting, to be honest. I know we're tools a little different, but I also always love to connect. So you have a face behind us. Definitely, if you have any questions, I don't know if you've worked directly with us yet, but happy to walk you through. As a partner, preferred partner of One Digital, what we do. And then, yeah, of course, the quote, want to walk you through any of the numbers and make sure we're aligned with how it looks. \nJeff Lue:\nSo I actually do have some pretty pointed questions I'd love to ask. Yeah, sure. Because I feel like I don't, well, if we go there, you can kind of tell me about the company, but I understand. You guys do Icarus. That's your space. You kind of mastered it, which is great. So I'm good with that. Okay. So my question, if you don't mind, just to kind of, because I have two questions. One and another. Two, but one is, it looks like I saw your quote for, this is for J&H reptile Mythology, correct? Correct, yes. And if I'm not mistaken, it looks higher than their current. Plan is that. Am I looking at that correctly? \nSeth Wood:\nSo let me, if it's okay, kind of share a little insight on how we quote and the options for they have. And I think that'll maybe explain a little more. Because, uh, I think that's going to illuminate this for you a little bit better of what, what they they have. So there's two ways an employer can do an allowance. Uh, you can give everybody the same amount, which is what they're doing today. Roughly, I saw that three, 332, 24, 332 dollars for every employee roughly. That's kind of what they're doing today. We can do that, so we can definitely give them the same, it wouldn't change anything and they'd just be doing the same amount. And I actually will share that quote with you today, too, if I didn't, the um, the reason that we did the first quote, what you're seeing with this quote, which is a lot more. They'll hear me share my screen. There's a lot more bells and whistles going on and it looks a little bit more complicated. It's not super complicated, but this is the one I sent with you, yes, what you do see here. So the plans on the individual marketplace are priced by age and location, and so we we prefer as a recommended route to do an age banded approach or dynamic range approach. That way, we can at least make sure that people that are older are getting, if a little bit more money to buy the same plan as somebody who's younger. Because their costs are higher for the premium. So this is kind of the most equitable way to do it. Now, that said, like the cost. Yes, the cost might be more higher than just giving everyone three, three, three, three hundred thirty three dollars, or whatever they're doing today. Right. So they can do that flat dollar amount. There's just going to be a little bit more cost to the employee, who is a little bit older on the. Out of pocket, beyond that, versus someone who's younger, because their plan premiums are higher and lower. So whatever's easiest for the customer to to digest, we can do, if it makes sense, which it could for the group to do. A standard, you know, like this version, which is just three, three hundred thirty three dollars, which is pretty much what they're doing today. 3.3.2. Whatever, and some change, and then the employees basically would just all get the same amount and then they can just look at the plans. And that should be fairly simpler to what they're doing today. But if they do want to make sure people have at least not too high out of pocket and they can get a little bit more, you can see, with this model, everyone's getting 354, 370, 243, 738, because that person is 58 years old and the cost might be double. So we're just trying to help as much as we can, basically. Does that make sense? Yes. \nJeff Lue:\nThat was actually my other key question. Help me understand this, because I'm sure this has to have come up before for you. \nSeth Wood:\nOh, yeah, it did. \nJeff Lue:\nHow does this work? Because this must be specific to Icarus, I'm assuming. \nSeth Wood:\nFor the age banding, the age, the allowance to give somebody more for compliance? \nJeff Lue:\nI guess contribution, if you want to say. Is that correct? Yeah. \nSeth Wood:\nSo just the question is, how are we able to give different age people more money legally? \nJeff Lue:\nYes. \nSeth Wood:\nYes. That's part of the ICRA. Yeah. So you can, there's rules you have to follow under ACA guideline. So, you know, because the marketplace in general is, it's like auto insurance, sort of, right? Auto insurance, you can charge a younger person more money because they haven't proven themselves on the road and they're younger. Older people pay way less in premiums in auto insurance. So it's the same idea on the healthcare marketplace, as far as just older people have usually higher costs. So they can't, they're not underwritten, meaning they can't charge you for pre-existing conditions and things like that. So these plans, in general, are the only thing they have as a lever is just the age and location in the marketplace to charge you more. So what we do that allows the IRS allows as an icra you to provide more money for someone who is older. To make sure that cost is offset, and you can do that as long as you're giving you. You're giving an allowance that increases with age, so you can't give an allowance that decreases with age that would not be compliant. So we can't give five hundred dollars to a 25 year old and 100 to a 50 year old that is super income, not compliant. Has to increase like a ladder with every age. If you do this like you can, you could give. You can keep it really simple and give 50 bucks or 500 bucks to someone who's 25 and 600 bucks to someone who's 50 and up. You could break it up that way, too, But there's also a 3-1 rule, meaning the spread between your youngest and your oldest employees allowance can't be more than 3x. Basically, you have to make sure they're aligned to some capacity. So as long as you follow those rules, you're good. And usually you do, and we do that with the tool, but it is not compliant. To do that way because the marketplace in general is, I wouldn't say unfair, but it's it's priced by the age. So we have to try to help them with that if they want. If the group is like, we just want to do $300, keep it flat, they definitely can do that. This group is not a applicable large employer, correct? They're not over 50 full-time equivalents, I imagine? Yeah, we'll say yes. They might be, okay. I understand, yes. So they are, okay. \nJeff Lue:\nMy question... Yeah. But that's a clear explanation. I think what? I don't know if you would feel this part of it, because I bet it's part of the big career. I'm assuming, is that not true? Because I would think, like, why wouldn't they just do that with their small group plan? \nSeth Wood:\nIt's different. I don't know everything. I don't, I trust you with the small group knowledge. But like with here, you're the guy I go to for that because I don't know anything about group. But ICRA, there are different affordability rules. There's different. You're definitely separate. I see. There's a totally different. Yeah. Yeah. \nJeff Lue:\nBecause I think I was just wondering about that, about the whole dynamic range. I was like, well, I was like, why don't we just do that as a small group? \nSeth Wood:\nYeah. \nJeff Lue:\nI mean, obviously, age rated as well. But you're going to run into the same issue. 25 year old versus a 60 year old. It's like, obviously the rates are huge, but yeah. \nSeth Wood:\nThere's some weird, there's not, there's some different, different rules in the ICRA. The main reason, the high level reason, there's different rules, the Icra is a type of HRA. The HRA is managed by the IRS, and the IRS has clear guidelines on it. So there's just, that's how the approach is going to be, slightly, slightly different in general. From our experience, then just a group plan has a lot more sometimes flexibility in some, some ways, because it's private insurance. You can, kind of. You can follow the law, you have to follow certain legal things, but here is very clearly like, yes, the law. It's black and white with the ikra. \nJeff Lue:\nYeah, um, okay, you may have answered this, but I still not fully understand this dynamic range. Okay, so, like, I'm looking at your screen, all right. yeah, your screen here. So, say, I'm assuming, is it set, like, say, at 50% right now? Is that, is it? \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, let me walk you through this. And I didn't explain this. First, well, I'll get into this question in a second. But what we do, let me just back out a little bit and look at the notes I took. Let me double check on a couple of things. Okay, so this is the data you provided me. So what we do. We, I believe you've provided, you send me a copy. Oh, I did. I have their plan, doc, too. So I'm just, just started to look behind the scenes. So this is their HMO deductible plan that they were on from last year. It's a 6250 out of pocket and a $1,500 deductible, medical deductible. So $1,500 deductible and a 6250, what I do is I take that information. And I want to compare Apples to apples. Where are they offering healthcare today? What does it look like if we translate this on the individual market with what their current plan is? Like, what level of coverage are they currently offering? We're just trying to benchmark against that specific 1500 deductible plan. And what we do is we don't, it's complicated, because there's a lot of plans. But what we're doing is we take all of the plans in California, where they're located. We put it against that deductible out of pocket. And we basically benchmark it against the percentile coverage. Like, so what I'm doing, a $1,500 deductible is basically, it's pretty low. That's probably a gold tier plan. That's our system helping us figure that out. And so they would be offering them, we take all the plans and we rank them from one to 100. 100 would be the highest, richest, lowest deductible comprehensive plan you can imagine. First percentile would just be like the base level starting plan in a tier. Right, like a gold might be, whatever. What's the lowest coverage level they have based on that deductible? Um, we figured it started out around a 25th percentile, so it's a mid to low level gold plan. And then we're basically looking at that as being our benchmark of the offering, so we can compare that plan to what they're offering today. So we're when we're doing the cost share below. That 50 50 split is what they're doing right now. That 300 300. When I looked at the the data, it's a perfect 50-50. And so we're basically trying to align it as close as we can to that. And we're just saying we're going to pay as the employer 50% towards that 25th percentile, or I could even do a first percentile lowest level gold plan for every employee. They're going to go and buy up. They're going to buy down. With this model, people will choose any plan they want. We don't know what they're going to choose. But as an employer, we just want to make sure we're at least contributing 50% of the premium of this level gold coverage. Does that make sense? \nJeff Lue:\nYeah, definitely more than the law, but it makes sense. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, I know. It's a little more, but it's just a little more complicated, especially if you have multiple states, market plans. Prices are different in every state, right? So that route allows us to kind of then go, okay, and that affects the cost share, of course, affects what you see here, right? So some people, it's very close to that 320 range they're already at. Some people, it's a lot higher because their plan costs are higher than that. So this is the more equitable, but also the more dynamic approach. Um, if they want to do like a flat dollar amount, they could also just do the simple flat dollar amount. But if they are an A le, you did mention they might be a over 50 and full-time equivalents. Then they might have to contribute a lot more here than this on the individual marketplace. Unless I misheard you, Um, right, right now, you're right. \nJeff Lue:\nSo is there, is there, I'm assuming. Is there a tool on your system for that? \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, do you see the red flags on the screen? Um, this is letting us know it's not compliant, so we're using the lowest. So actually, this is something that we can adjust and fix. I don't have the salary information, so do we, if we know the lowest level eligible employees salary? I can update this today, I'm just going by the poverty level, which means that's that tool is not accurate completely, so you would need to update. Quite a bit here to get it completely cleared. You can see the checklists on the right side. Check that. So if we know, hey, everyone's getting at least 50,000, 30,000, then I can update it, Our system is going to be making, you know, have a lot more wiggle room with what we can offer them. So, but yeah, at a 50% with the lowest level, I mean, we're not getting an exact count, but it will let you know, like, what's the minimums? Usually, if they're over 50, this model, the dynamic versus this model, which is just the flat dollar amount, I'm giving everyone $3.33. This model is going to be more cost efficient. Just because you'd have to give everybody the highest allowance for that employee who's older, usually. And that's going to be more expensive. So it may or may not be a fit, either way. Just thinking ahead, depending on what their costs are. And you know more. Like, tell me, are they the rates I'm looking at? are these the 2025 rates for them? are they their 2026 rates? \nJeff Lue:\nUm, I think I sent you the 2026 rates. \nSeth Wood:\nOkay, yeah, so I mean, I'm just trying to be like, I can't. I mean, obviously if we had wiggle room here, we could tell. But if I'm even doing, let's just do 50. To be very liberal or conservative, maybe better the word, um, you know. They're currently paying 70, 7309 per month for 2026, if that sounds right. Sure. And this would be an increase, fees aside, forget that, this would be an increase about 9,269 a month, potentially, if we're doing a 50-50 split. So the cost could be higher, potentially. \nJeff Lue:\nGot it, got it. Okay. Okay, yeah, so that's, okay. Got it. So the big guy can do flat dollar, or they can do this dynamic, which is a bit fair to say, because this dynamic part does like a behind the scenes calculation. That the employer and myself don't really know what it is. So like, if I'm looking at, these names are super hard, but like the third one, Boonseri, like, yeah, like, how do I? How do I explain that? That's your allowance? \nSeth Wood:\nYes, so it shows right here on the right side the checklist, it shows the checks that are in not in compliance, and it'll give an explanation right here. The big reason for this we have to give, the reason that would not be compliant is we have to give based on the salary information of the employee. We have to give them at least 9.96%. They can't pay more than 9.96% of their household income on the low-level Silver plan. So with this methodology... We go by the lowest eligible employees salary on the list. And to be honest, this tool does over create a higher gap there, a little bit more than the even minimum affordability. The reason being is, if they hire somebody on through the year and they get paid less, we want to buffer and anticipate anything that could happen to keep them compliant. So there is some wiggle room, but this usually is within the range of where they need to be. So if they really want to calculate and get down, they can do that. But they're going to go on like the Health Exchange website, because that's where we're going to pull that information from. And find the lowest level silver for that employee in their area. And then they just have to make sure they're getting paid enough to do that. Given that it's so close, I'm even let's go to the other tool, 333. There are 7309 again. It would be 7326 pre fees, you know, so. Their rates for, and I could be off, but if they're wanting, they could keep it the same, if they're keeping it identical on this. I mean, basically, they're paying around the same, this versus the ICRA. It doesn't really seem like there's a ton of advantage, cost advantage to them right now. \nJeff Lue:\nRight. So, again, that's what I kind of took away without talking to you yet, which is kind of looking over this. I was like, it seems as though there's no real advantage for them to do this. Right. At least, you know, just looking at the straight cost. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. For this time around, when we do this, it looks great. because, you know, we're going to see like it'll look more like on the right, like like this. Right. You'll see this negative, this arrow. You'll see five and we'll go, oh, wow, They're paying 87 a year, and this could bring it down to 62, or even the fees. It's 74, and the fees are, you know, just so, you know, like, your standard. PEPM per employee enrolled is $30 per month per employee that enrolls per month as standard. So. You can go up and down, just let us know, always. \nJeff Lue:\nGot it. Okay. You mentioned about the plans. Are you, so, you know, we're California, so do you guys just use, like, covered California plans? Is that a good reference? Like, hey, take a look at what's on. Covered California. \nSeth Wood:\nYou can do covered California. The easy way, though, is we get these off exchange from the carriers, so we can basically enroll them directly. With the carrier and not have to have them go on the exchange. We don't want to do that. That's not ideal. So that way, the employee, the employer pays through Thatch, the carrier directly every month for all the premiums in one invoice. And then we enroll them automatically into the plan off exchange. I will send you this link, thatch.com slash plans. You can type in the employee's information and type in their name. \nJeff Lue:\nExactly. \nSeth Wood:\nSo this is my old Zip code here. And you can see like Southern California, for example, has 43 plans starting at based on that age 379 for bronze, silver 410, gold 463. We can kind of get an idea there for what the options would be depending. \nJeff Lue:\nYeah, yeah, that would be. That would definitely be helpful. \nSeth Wood:\nUh, yeah, for sure. And then the tool also will show you that if you just click on an employee FYI like the View plans. It'll break down all of that same information. With whatever allowance that we've adjusted here on the left and show them what they'd be paying and stuff there, too. \nJeff Lue:\nSo can I use that just for any group, or does it have to be, oh, for any group? \nSeth Wood:\nI would use that, that tool. Use this tool if you want to get an idea. If you want a quote, you just. You can send it over in the future to me. And we can run it without having to meet. Once you understand the tool, I can just run it. I can just give you a little blurb. Hey, this one seems potentially like a fit, or this doesn't. As long as you understand the tool, I think it's a lot easier to to figure out. \nJeff Lue:\nBut yeah, okay, another question. So I know, like I worked with Take Command before. Um, I'm assuming that's a competitor, right? is that or not? Really? Yeah, they're, they're, they're a competitor. \nSeth Wood:\nBut we've got a lot of their customers switching from them to us this year for a lot of different reasons. But yeah, we're more tech forward than they are, and Yeah, a lot more seamless than they have in their experiences, from what I understand, with other customers. \nJeff Lue:\nYeah, so that's what I was going to ask you. Because my experience is that it's pretty straightforward, for the most part on take Command. But the one piece that I felt was kind of a huge miss on their side, and I'm hoping you guys do, is kind of the whole help with the filing. Because I'm assuming you still have to do the whole recovery fee and all that stuff. Or stop. \nSeth Wood:\nSo, some of the customers that I've worked with take command, and I don't know if this is your experience, but they use multiple vendors. To connect everything together, we do everything in one place, in-house. It's all through thatch. So like we handle just to kind of give you like a high level. Like we do all the filings for them, everything is included, right? So like ACAS filings 1095, we manage the cobra, we do it. We two weeks, one stop shop and no employees going on the exchange. It's through thatch 90% of the time, like, there's a couple of states that are weird. That's just like New York or some other weird ones, but every other employee goes through thatch. So I would say, Take Command has not invested in the technology, and the technology has made the ICHRA a lot more appealing. And so they go through the thatch for the enrollment, they choose the plan. And then they get, if they have leftover dollars with the ICHRA, cause they can have that option. If they want to have leftover dollars, they have a thatch debit card we have for them so they can utilize those unqualified medical expenses. We have a marketplace that we've built out. It's a lot more streamlined. And then administratively for the employer, which is super important, they have like a batch dashboard where they can, like this, they see the view of all their employees that have enrolled. They can see and generate reports. They can also off-board the employee, right? If they're done, they can click off-board, and then we'll send out the Cobra notice right away and then stop the payments. And so they can do a lot. It's a lot. The product is very good. Like, I, we're from, we're from Stripe, Rex, Ramp, FinTech. That's kind of how we built the background, backend of things. We have had no delinquencies in four years. So like, we're very, very tech forward. And that helps the problems that some of the other vendors that we've had now, no shade on anyone's just, we hear other ICHRA providers. We had a lot of customers switching from other providers to us this year. So I think it shows that not everyone does the basics really perfectly, and some people get more. You know, bad experiences, right? And so at least we have good infrastructure here that we've built out. \nJeff Lue:\nYeah, that's, that's really helpful. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, I'll send you some videos, onboarding resources, just so you have your back pockets you can look at later with us. But yeah, like, obviously, this group is not perfect here. And if it was these were the 2025 rates, I'd be like, Oh, maybe 26 is still higher and this could be more competitive. But in that case, this is, yeah. I think your instinct was totally fair and I that's why I just sent it over just to get you. At least take a look at it. But it doesn't seem like a home run hit, for sure. \nJeff Lue:\nYeah, um, I know we're running out of time here. But I had a my other group. I quoted to a smaller group. I forgot who I talked to. Um, but it was four lives, was it? JOSEPH Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. Um, that might work. I guess, I think, you know, we're struggling with. The whole contribution is right now, they are doing like a percentage, like a 75% of Kaiser's 70%. That's kind of how it started. Got it. Then, you know, it was showing me the dynamic rate, and then, you know, either dynamic rate, or flat rate, flat dollar. Could they still do a percentage kind of more traditionally, or is that not really? \nSeth Wood:\nOnly because these are in dollar amounts. It's harder to, you can't really do a percentage on individual plans. So we can do a percentage with the dynamic, but it's a percentage of a benchmark. It's not like a percentage of a plan and it's going to be the more dynamic. If it's a group for people, are they in the same age range? Are they kind of all over the place? \nJeff Lue:\nRight. Rough, It's kind of rough, it's probably like late 40s, the one, and another one is 60. That was. \nSeth Wood:\nI was asking what I would be doing. I would, I mean, I know they're doing it already. I would just be saying, what's the 75 in dollar amounts currently? What does it look like if we just do that flat rate for everybody, because that's the easiest path, especially with only four employees? Usually, flat dollars seem to be pretty good if they're in the same Zip code, if they're not, and the ages or variants. Dynamic can make a lot more healthier sense, but they can contribute whatever they want. Um, but that's the shifting mindset of the ICHRA. It's just it's like, what do you want to budget, like, how much do you want to spend on your health care for your employees? And that's that's the freedom they have, the flexibility they have. So it's going to be more like, because the plans might cost a different amount on the individual market than they do here, they might be less for some people. So I would just be focusing on the dollar amount they're currently spending on each employee and try to average it or figure out if a flat dollar could work. Just to keep it easy for them to comprehend. \nJeff Lue:\nLike, that's what we used to do, but that's cool. I can share that with that group. They can look at it and those would be, would those actually be plans that would be available, should they go this route? Okay. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, yeah, yeah. And also, Don, we are happy to jump in. Joe could jump in. You're not having to, you can definitely show the interest, build that up if you have, you think this could be helpful, But we would always want to jump on a call to show the demo and walk them through the quote, too. So don't feel like you have to position this alone with that. You're, you're allowed to ask us. We prefer to do it that way because it's it's you're not going to know. Ikra, I know Ikra, I don't know. Group, I would trust you to group. If I had a group plan. I'd be like, Hey, I've got my guy, Jeff, I'm gonna have you talk to Jeff, like he's gonna tell you everything you need to know. I wouldn't know anything about that. So let us be a resource. \nJeff Lue:\nYeah, another question is, for now, uh, turn around time. So, like, you know, obviously one one's around the corner. 221. What do we? \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, we can do a one-one. Our standard cutoff enrollment standard has been the 22nd, Monday. Setting up a badge account is not hard. It takes 10 minutes to set up an admin account. And then the only time, the only thing that can take two to three days is just bank verification, in case that needs to be manually verified. So we need to move this week. If it's needed to be done, we could get an extension for the 28th. We could move that out a little further. That's a possibility. You could talk to Joe about that group. Um, that can be done. Worst case, then, if that's not doable, they need more time. We could look at a 2-1, but it's we have groups bigger in size that are looking to potentially move forward. Uh, this week, so yeah, yeah, in this case, uh, I will. \nJeff Lue:\nSorry, this other group, not the group we're talking about, um, probably would be a two one perfect. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, yeah, that in the beginning of the next month, you know, if they get things rolling, this is what they want to do, we could. They could then give their team at least two weeks to choose a plan. It's standard. \nJeff Lue:\nSo, one more question. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, you're good. \nJeff Lue:\nBecause I guess, so when I was talking to him, I'm saying, that had taken me. But then they dropped it a year ago. So he wasn't sure if they had to restart it. He thought they restarted. They had to restart it on one one. I said, can you find out that? \nSeth Wood:\nWell, I'll take that. Are they on a group plan today, though? Or no? \nJeff Lue:\nNothing. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, like, I would circle back with them on that. I don't know the answer, so I don't want to steer you wrong. But my opinion would be, if they're not currently on an ICRA, and they don't have any current plans, I don't know why it would make any difference. Like, I don't understand. \nJeff Lue:\nLike, there's nothing in place. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, like, my gut instinct, but I could be totally wrong, because healthcare is complicated. So. \nJeff Lue:\nI don't know. \nSeth Wood:\nIt's not easy. Yeah. But yeah, I do have to hop off. If you do have questions that pop up after, feel free to shoot me an email. I'm happy to look into them. But yeah, we'll get the next one, hopefully. And yeah, just keep us in the loop. Yeah, I did. I'll send you the flat dollar amount one, too. And if you want to run, if you know the salary information, I can rerun it with the right salary information. But I don't, it's not going to really make a difference. Yeah, I don't think it matters to myself. \nJeff Lue:\nOkay, at this point. \nSeth Wood:\nI agree. Yeah, yeah. Okay, cool. \nJeff Lue:\nThanks, I appreciate it. \nSeth Wood:\nYou too. Have a great week. Bye. Bye. \n",

Okay. \nTonya Salter:\nI'm feeling the same. So it's must be going around like I can't breathe this morning. Yeah. \nZach Laurer:\nAt all. Yeah, it's, my wife was sick for like two weeks and then my kids have, they always bring home crap from school and daycare. \nTonya Salter:\nYeah. \nZach Laurer:\nSo it was a matter of time for me. Yeah. \nTonya Salter:\nNo, I'm sorry. Yeah, I feel you. Over the weekend it just started like, I don't know, like my chest and my nose and just, yeah. Don't feel great, but we'll get through it. \nZach Laurer:\nI know, I know. Fight through it. It's hard like early in the morning, that's the worst part. \nTonya Salter:\nYeah, the morning is always the worst. \nZach Laurer:\nYou're like, where's my brain? Why is it not functioning right now? \nTonya Salter:\nExactly. Exactly. Yeah. Definitely a little cloudy today. \nZach Laurer:\nYesterday when you guys were like, do you want to take a a note for a DP or whatever? I Was like, I want to, so bad, but I can't even, I don't even know where I'm at right now. \nTonya Salter:\nYeah, no worries. No worries at all. Yeah, didn't mean to throw you into that either. Cool. Well we're kind of sort of halfway through the week, so we'll get there. I know, I know. \nZach Laurer:\nAre you traveling for Christmas at all or just staying put? \nTonya Salter:\nNo, I'm staying put. I'm here. My family's just like 15 minutes away from me. That's right. So yeah, I'll just be here. What about you? \nZach Laurer:\nSame. My parents live here now. They, they've lived in Maryland for like two years and then my in-laws are coming in from Cleveland as well, so. \nTonya Salter:\nOh, nice. \nZach Laurer:\nBig happy family. Yeah. \nTonya Salter:\nThat'll be fun. How, how many kids do you have? Just two. \nZach Laurer:\nTwo. \nTonya Salter:\nAnd what are their ages? \nZach Laurer:\nGrace is seven, well we'll be seven and like a couple weeks and then my son Teddy is two and a half. Cute. \nTonya Salter:\nThat's horrible. Close in age. \nChristian:\nHey guys. \nmessengd:\nGood. \nTonya Salter:\nHow are you? \nmessengd:\nWe're living living. \nTonya Salter:\nWe are living. \nmessengd:\nI'm Ready for Christmas. \nTonya Salter:\nYeah, I feel you. Me too. We're almost there. It's actually coming up a lot faster than I thought, to be honest next week. Holy cow. Cool. Well thank you guys for joining Christian. First off, I was just looking at that email that you sent this morning that it looks like Nick responded to about Sailor 100 Group, but I've been seeing some errors or like issues where you'll go through the process of connecting a DP run and then it brings you back to the that account and then nothing happens. Like you go through it all, they subscribe to the marketplace, they log in a DP and then just brings them back into that and nothing is actually connected. Does that sound similar to what you guys experienced? \nChristian:\nYeah, that one with that specific group. Yeah, I had that happen. That's the only group I've had it happen on where she, she walked through, she logged in, she added to marketplace, went back to that, approved the syncing and then it just never did. \nTonya Salter:\nOkay, Good to know. So, okay, then I will add this to a ticket and we will get that fixed here shortly. \nChristian:\nWe just got a, we just got some new merchant by the way. Nice. \nTonya Salter:\nAwesome. Send it our way Referring echo. That's pretty cool. \nChristian:\nThat's awesome. Do you guys know about our contest that we just launched? \nTonya Salter:\nI don't know. I don't think so. Yeah, what is that? \nChristian:\nSo, So we changed the comp structure for the next like three months for referring dms in two of our biggest spaces. So instead of getting per employee per month, they're getting based off of how many employees are active on payroll. It's kind of an incentive for employees to push out and it's huge money. Yeah, it sounds like huge Money over 10 Plus if it's 10 plus employees they get 1800. If it's 25 plus it's 4,100 in roll call, which is wow massive for these guys. Like that's one of the highest paying for for n bu. So there's gonna be a lot of leads come in. We just hired two more people to run icra on our teams so I am teaching one of them now. I think Devin has some communications with the other one that we're working with. So Yeah, big thing. \nTonya Salter:\nSweet. We're growing. \nmessengd:\nWe're Growing. \nTonya Salter:\nThat's awesome. Awesome to hear. Wow, very cool. \nChristian:\nThat businesses Sweet. \nTonya Salter:\nWell that's good to know. And those two new reps that you guys have too, I think we're having a training with them tomorrow just so you know too. Perfect. So we're just gonna do a whole walkthrough of the thatch platform IRAs, they're not familiar with it and then we'll probably set up some time with them as well over the next few weeks just to get them kind of ramped up too. But happy to hear you guys are also like helping with like the training and getting them more familiar with with it. \nZach Laurer:\nChris, Quick question for me, Chris, where are you guys based out of? Christian and Devin. \nChristian:\nI'm in Allentown, Devon. I'm in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Devon's over in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. And then we have a new rep in Tucson, Arizona and a new rep in town Pennsylvania. Nice. \nZach Laurer:\nOkay. Hey cool. \nNic Paul:\nQuick question on those new reps. 'cause as Tanya just mentioned, we are meeting with 'em tomorrow. Is, do you have any idea because we have no, like what their group insurance knowledge is and then B like I'm gonna assume Icor they don't know anything about. Yeah, yeah. \nChristian:\nSo the one, I'm the one I'm kind of working with, she has sold group health insurance before. Okay. Now she knows a good amount about Icra because she was with me the entire day yesterday and I broke up. Oh cool. \nNic Paul:\nEverything to her. \nChristian:\nSo she'll, she has like a good base understanding of it I think. Like Priscilla? Yeah, Priscilla. Yeah. Okay. And then I think it's, it's still important probably to go through like again what RA is and like all that kind of good stuff and the knockouts. But like to be honest, I know Priscilla has a pretty good wrap on it so far, so. Okay. I'm not sure about the other one. \nmessengd:\nYeah, I just connected with the other one like literally a couple minutes before this meeting just connected with her, Courtney, she kind of got thrown into Ring of Fire, came back from vacation, said this is now your new job. So she's a little overwhelmed right now. Definitely. I'm bringing her on a call. I have a full account set up today at 4 45. It was with that weird account that I pinged you about the Russian and Ukrainian. But I told him, I was like, you're gonna have to help them out. Like that's you. I don't think a DP has anything that's just like, and he was okay with it. He was like, yeah, it's no big deal. I can help them like at least translate the plans and explain what means what. \nChristian:\nYeah. \nmessengd:\nBut she's gonna hop on that call with me today at four forty five just to kind of go through a setup so she can see everything fully integrated, how everything's going to work. Yeah, I think she, she's gonna be fine. She did health for a year. She knows how to do it. Okay. I just told her, I said, your process is not three weeks anymore. Your process is three days. Yeah. You want everything done in two to three days outta sight outta mind as fast as you possibly can because the product itself can move that quick. Yeah, yeah. \nNic Paul:\nYeah. So that's interesting. You, you just touched on something I I've been wondering about, but so that's how fast you guys go from initial call to then closed sold or closed one is three days because I definitely know like in the traditional group world, like that's a slog. Right. So like from a volume standpoint, are you, when you compare it to being in the group world before, right? Are you doing enough volume at this point that actually you expect to exceed kinda like what you were doing with group? \nmessengd:\nYes. Like I'm, my numbers over the last two months are not even like I looked at my performance from the first three months, you know, first quarter pretty much to now I'm like 2K off of two or three K give or take. But I have 12 units in this month. Like Yeah We are gonna start making a disgusting amount of money and commission Christian and I just off of units. Like that's exciting And that's just the biggest thing that I think we both, and I, I stress that to the Courtney. I was like, look, your, your day from the minute you start is now full every single day. You don't have Mondays and Fridays to be at home and like, oh, if you wanna mess around in the house for an hour, clean some dishes, that doesn't exist anymore. You are opening up your laptop whenever you open up your laptop and you are going until you close your laptop every day. I said, you're gonna lead your team in talk time every week. You're probably gonna be middle of the road in dials, but your activity's gonna be a hundred almost every single day because it's just so fast paced. Like Yeah, ideally I don't want to, if a client doesn't get back to you within a week, I don't, I I have no reason to talk to them. That's the way I think about it. Like if you can't get a census back to me in a week anymore, I, I don't have the time to check up with you every morning. I don't have the time for that and I don't have the time to go to your run account and pull your run information because I have clients that are actually sending me back censuses that have a contribution figured out that want to be done. So my turnaround, I love it to be like two to three days. Like just go, go, go, go every single day you get in here. Like that's why I drop 'em in. So like groups like some days it'll be like three in a row, three in a row, three in a row and it's been like that for like the last couple weeks and I'm loving it. \nNic Paul:\nCan I ask then a follow up question to that? Is it that sort of volume right And that sort of like I just opportunities, is it because you guys are getting so many more leads 'cause they're all getting funneled to you or just the nature of the icra speed right. To close a deal? \nmessengd:\nI think it's a mix honestly. Okay. We definitely get a lot of leads. We definitely are overwhelmed with that and I think that's why they're bringing on the other two reps. Christian, I'm sure you can attest to that, but it's also the nature of the product. Like yeah, there's no way to stall. We don't need to stall this. This doesn't need to be something that we drag and drag and drag because all you need to care about as the employer, it's your contribution. You figure out that number I'm done with you. You know what I mean? \nZach Laurer:\nLike yeah, yeah. \nmessengd:\nYou go through our integration call, that's 30 minutes. I don't talk to you ever again. You know like yes if you send me an email or you give me a call, you have questions, not a problem. But that would, when it comes to that initial setup, I love waiting until I see everything green at the end. You know, I see that invite getting sent, I see it, everything's clicked through and then I've been stressing, hey you need to tell your employees get on this today. That's it. Do it. Awesome While it's in front of mind because it, in my opinion, if you want health insurance, you're not gonna drag your feet on it. Yeah. You know It's important. \nNic Paul:\nLike you said, basically if it a week of silence, like you pretty much know right. They're not, You don't want it. They don't have the budget. Yeah they don't have the money. They don't want something along those lines. Exactly. But usually. So let me ask you then also from those leads, are you guys getting leads from your other deal desk like teammates or these are just straight up leads that are coming from like the deal desk way, right. \nmessengd:\nAnd then they're icra specific so it's getting to you Icra specific but we're also getting a lot, and I know Christian is too, we're getting a lot of bubble down from h and b for what? Just health and benefits like our initial h and b partners like Okay. That we're teammates with like for instance Sutherland's team, they all have access to thatch but I don't Christian does your team have access to thatch? Like everybody? Yeah. Okay. So I know we get a lot of bubble downs though from like different h and b reps or even our total source reps that they're running into the participation issues or people are leaving total source because of the cost associated with it. \nNic Paul:\nYeah. Yeah. \nmessengd:\nAnd then that's how we're getting like a lot of leads I'm getting already have a census information in them. Like that's so easy to turn around. Like I'm sending a quote as I'm on the phone with them, you know what I mean? I'm like hey yeah, yeah this is gonna come over with an AI generated contribution. Don't worry about that. We can edit that. Let me know when you have more time. We can set up a day and time to review this call or to review this quote. Okay. \nNic Paul:\nNo this has been super helpful man because that's Oh it's awesome. Something No that that that's exactly what kind of when we've been making adjustments and then once we heard about you guys being specific icra focused, we were obviously excited about it but from an overall just a DP thatch partnership, one of the things that I think we were trying to paint the picture of is exactly what you just did. Which is instead of a traditional level funded deal, taking three weeks right. To drag on getting the individual apps, all that, you know, minutiae and bullshit, right? That's a pain. Exactly. Like you're able to go to a two to three day or two to three like sales cycle, right? So from a volume standpoint you're able to close a whole lot more, whole lot faster. And that's gonna from a curve standpoint, exceed really that traditional group where it's kinda like plugging along, right? And you're trying to find those opportunities that line up and how many of them right? You get the apps back and it's a no surprise a dog shit group that has high risk. Yeah. \nmessengd:\nRight. \nNic Paul:\nOr horrible participation when you finally go through the pain. Trust me, I mean the life of a carrier rep, I've been there, done that. So is Tanya. So Zach. So we totally feel those pains and that's definitely one of the things that has always really excited me about the icra, right? Is what you see is what you get, right? Like it's final, it's guaranteed issue, right? So it's the ability like you just need to make a decision, you know, Mr. And Mrs. Employer, do you wanna do this? Do you not? What is your budget? Let's talk about that. So no, this has been super helpful man. Thank you so much. \nZach Laurer:\nWhat, I got a question like yeah you, you both seem very excited about this opportunity. You know when it comes to like your roll call meetings, like how are the other reps you know, embracing this or are there any like frustrations or things that we could help, you know, move things along for them? \nNic Paul:\nYeah, You're just amongst us girls. \nZach Laurer:\nYou know give, I will say I know how Stressful roll call meetings are. \nmessengd:\nI was, I used to be A A DP so it's For my team personally they don't, they don't care 'cause I'm backpacking so many units. Yeah they're like Dev you're putting in 12 units, you are almost at half of our team's quota for units. We can backpack you on K or two of rev. You know what I mean? It's like a, you are doing doing X, Y and Z. You're dropping so many units that effectively, you know, to get to that team 100% that really matters. You know what I mean? Like they're not really upset about it. My SE cam has told me straight up, he is like, dude, I don't care about Rev anymore. Rev doesn't matter for you. The only thing that matters is units like that is all I care about. So he just wants me to burn and turn. I'm sure Christian you're probably in a similar boat. Yeah, we want to get to a hundred percent on both to get that extra money but also in the same breath, like Christian, you're already in doubler for units. I'm like a couple behind him at this point. So that's really where we're gonna make our, our our bread at this year is just getting to that unit doubler and then just running it up. Yeah. \nChristian:\nAnd awesome. And like with, with roll call meetings, like the money's still there. Like the revenue's still there. 'cause last, last month I hit 16 K for 16 units. So my units were literally double everyone else's on my team and my revenue was double what my quota was, which was also the second highest in my team. So like there, I'm not sacrificing any revenue but I'm also just launching all the units in our team team. So like they're loving it. We're our team right is like hundred 70% mostly because over the been dropping big unit numbers. So like they love it Also, I think like Nick you were asking about how like why, why we think it's so successful and so busy right now. I think another portion of it is a lot of the people we're working with, they are so used to getting roll call like now, like they're used to getting roll call in a couple of days when they send a lead, a couple days go by, they're getting that money. They don't wanna wait the 30 to 45 days that they wait when they're looking at a group health plan. To be honest, like our group health reps are not the best in the business. Like they're just, they, they don't follow up enough. It's not something that we have like completely dialed in. So when we have, yeah, so when we have a mix of me and Devon as reps that are like we're, we're staying on top of it and we're filling our partners in, we're also getting them more closes. We're also closing it faster and they also are getting paid more off of icra than they are group. Like it just becomes a no brainer to, to send as much icra as possible. And we've shifted from, we don't pitch health and benefits to, we love to add health and benefits. I ccra specifically into our talk track and they love to push health and benefits. I I hear it on all the calls around me. I get a ton of warm tea a day. Me and Devin are getting like 40 to 50 leads a week on average. And obviously that's insane. Which is why of course we're bringing on the new reps because like it that's a, that's a workload that like we just, I'm losing revenue daily because I can't get, I can't follow up enough with the the employers that I And fast enough too, right? \nNic Paul:\nBecause once you start getting some of those or like, oh yeah, tell me about a RI want, right? Like I know how those calls go, right? It's a 30 to 45 minute conversation. And then Devin, I think you touched upon it Christian, we've definitely seen it as well with you. Like it's initial call and then typically second call, right? Nail down your contribution strategy and then it's onboard done, right. So I mean it's a fast, it takes some time right in those two to three days to meet twice with them. But I hear exactly what you're saying. It's just like, it's that speed to lead type follow up and then striking while the iron's hot. You know? \nZach Laurer:\nDo you guys feel comfortable with like their transit transition after one one with like deductibles resetting? Like as we get later into 2026 or do you think the team needs like talking points around that? \nmessengd:\nYou go Christian, you go. My bad, I'm, I'm good with it. \nChristian:\nI mean I, I think, I think we'll be fine. For me it's just kind of a matter of explaining the universe renewal and it's, yeah, it's something that if they want the coverage to start then that's what they're gonna, that's what they're gonna get. Most of the time we're dealing with people that can't go group and also ICRA is just much more attractive on all standpoints. The $45 is something that you're able to easily talk away with all of the integration and the support that they get, but also the tax savings are there to offset that. I've gotten a lot of like, hey, like what if I, what if I just increase their, their income by X amount And I'm like sure you can do that, but you also can then pay tax, payroll tax on that money. They can pay income tax on that money and instead of contributing 500 and paying 45, you're contributing 500 and paying $200 in taxes. Yeah. So what would you prefer? So yeah, I I think it's, I don't think it's gonna be a challenge at least for myself to, to keep pushing that through the, through the later months of the year. And especially like last month I was like telling people if they, or two months ago I was telling people, hey if you want 11 one completely fine but you're gonna reset like your next two months is going to be useless 'cause you're going to reset January. And they're like, okay we want coverage January. I'm like okay sure. \nmessengd:\nYeah That's Great. \nNic Paul:\nGoing back to the roll call real quick. So like that's a more like instantaneous payout, is that what I'm understanding? Sorry, I the roll call thing, I'm not really, I organization, I don't get it. So it's kinda like that instant fix versus the group, right? Again you have that 30 to 45 day payout window that you're waiting on so. Gotcha. \nmessengd:\nAnd also too, like we got A-Q-B-M-S when small group that can take, I mean Christian, I know you've been there, QBM S sucks. You could, what is it? QBM s it's like our system that we would if we were still doing small group that we have to put everything into Got you For for the A DP side. So we get paid, our partners get paid. \nNic Paul:\nYeah you get the finalized enrollment census, right? Which then you're booking in this system with then what the, that's your payout. But then you're waiting 30 to 45 days 'cause the carrier doesn't start paying until typically 30 days net. \nmessengd:\nYou know, and like QBMS takes a day. Like if you mess up literally any little detail in QBMS, you are going to spend not one day now it is four days fixing it. Yeah. You know what I mean? Like that backend work, that backend headache is like truly the worst part in my opinion of small group healthcare. It is awful. I mean submitting docs to the carrier that takes, that takes a, yeah Submitting everything and when you don't have to worry about that and you see that green go that final invite, finish onboarding, you get that peace of mind all right I'm done. And then also you just ping your partner and say hey expect this to hit, is it gonna hit this month? Yep. It'll hit your beacon soon. We don't really, and it it's out of our hands. So that's like another really nice thing. So if you ever get a partner who's like kind of picking at you like hey where's my roll call? Hey it's completely outta my hands. You're gonna get it. I can't guarantee you the exact day it will be on this month because it's not through my beacon yet. \nNic Paul:\nAnd they're like, the checks in the mail Man don't break my knees. \nmessengd:\nYY you know what I mean? Like it's just like I know for me personally it's just so much less of a headache. Like Yeah sometimes you know they, we got 10 reps splitting $120 now. I mean it is what it is. You know what I mean? Yeah. With this new payout system though, they're going to increase substantially. So when do you do have three, four reps splitting a deal now it's gonna give them some value. You know what I mean? Like that's part of the issue with like I think why they changed the payout structure just because it wasn't really, in my opinion, giving the partners enough it should have been given them a little bit more. Especially 'cause we get a lot of bubble downs from an H and B rep who had a rep send them that lead. So now you're splitting that roll call. Yeah. You know what I mean? Like it's just like gets messy quick but also to our close Christian did you see that email today from DeRosa? This one from DeRosa? The weekly update. \nChristian:\nOh yeah, yeah, yeah. \nmessengd:\nWe're killing it dude. Our close percent is high. Yeah you guys, it's crazy crushing it. \nNic Paul:\nLike that's, that's why we're asking these questions because it's just we're not seeing the same success on the other teams. Right. Quite like the way that we're seeing with you guys and our hypothesis is what you're proving right by you guys being dedicated to just ier deals and ier deals. Only a just better cleaner submissions, right? Information going to the clients is correct and also like you're gonna live and die by this just the same way that we do. And sorry, I know we're coming up on time here, but I wanted to go back to something else just so clarification for myself. When you guys were doing the small business stuff, I felt like especially sub 50, most carriers require quarterly wage and tax, which is like a huge pain in the ass. Yep, yep. \nmessengd:\nRight. \nNic Paul:\nSo does a DP do that in-house if you have the payroll, do they do quarterly wage and tax? Okay. So it's a lot easier for you guys to pull at least, but it's still from when they still sucks audit that on the carrier side saying hey you have all these employees on this. Like it's not matching up to the census. So like I dude, I I love it. I Hated quarterly wage and tax so much like right, you gotta get, Gotta get authorizations for everything. \nmessengd:\nLike oh this person does yes this quarter they worked more hours because it was their busy season but they don't really work full-time hours and then you gotta go back date that correct that get authorization for a signature. So that's another DocuSign now sent. We don't do any of that shit. It's done. I love it. \nNic Paul:\nYeah, no I'm with you dude. Trust me again, like coming to the April roll, those were some of the things I was just like, dude this is so much cleaner, faster and like so then follow up question on that because I know again it what about for like a virgin group that hasn't filed their quarterly wage tax? Like usually UHC would do a payroll but they would require like the most recent payroll, you know so like is that pretty standard for the other carriers too? Yeah. \nmessengd:\nYeah. \nNic Paul:\nThey all want something Still to your point you get those audits of like, well hey, where's this employee coming from? \nmessengd:\nAnd then you're like damn like gotcha. Yeah. \nNic Paul:\nOkay cool. Sorry I totally, I apologize for being late and I apologize on hijacking this meeting. Is there stuff that we can help you with or like improvements or what can we do to make your life better and keep that awesome close ratio that you guys are crushing? \nmessengd:\nNo, this is gonna be a weird ask on our prospects page. Is there any way we can get a search bar? I'm up to like 70 clients in that. Yeah and it's just getting like a headache because a lot of them I have to share twice. Christian, I don't know if you've run into this issue when a quote sits for too long and you go to resend it with onboarding privileges, it keeps it on the same screen. It doesn't say save and create that account. So I just redraw up the quote as I have the client on the phone, you know it only takes two minutes to just copy and paste, copy and paste, copy and paste. But then it's like you're going back looking through everything. Like even if we could delete quotes outta that prospect page too, that would be awesome just to clean it up a little bit because I have like almost 70 accounts in that right now and it's just like click scroll, scroll, scroll. Is this the good quote? Is this the bad quote? Is this the one I can send? You know what I mean? So yeah that would be really dope. \nTonya Salter:\nYes, that's a good call out. \nNic Paul:\nAre you post that right now Tanya? \nTonya Salter:\nYeah, I'm writing it down. Awesome, thank you'll I'll send it to our product team. They, they do actually listen to feedback and they'll start implementing stuff. So I have, yeah get a search bar for on that prospect page and then also the ability to delete prospects too. Like if it's just like a duplicate or like old one one that you're not using to make it a little bit cleaner for You. That'd be awesome. \nmessengd:\nThat'd be awesome. Yeah. And also we are past, I know we talked about this a couple weeks back, I wanna say like two weeks ago integrating a plan, we're past that deadline for one one, could they get an FSA like thatch card for the first month and then two one be fully integrated into that? What do you mean? So you know how like people have different marketplace plans like this one client I'm dealing with? Yeah. Has a marketplace plan that they, they don't want any changes but they want that employer contribution and like Christian mentioned earlier, they don't want to just throw it into payroll 'cause now that changes the tax benefits. Right? So we were gonna go and I explained to them like we were past the deadline to get that outside thatch plan fully integrated into thatch with the payroll deductions. Could we set it up so like one one they get that $700 contribution on the FSA card and then come month two we can fully integrate that plan in. Is that an option? Integrate still? Okay, we're I thought we were past that deadline of, of moving the plan. \nNic Paul:\nNo, the deadline was for them to sign up. Right. \nChristian:\nOkay. \nNic Paul:\nSo especially marketplace that window closed yesterday is my understanding you like if they're doing like an on exchange plan, like if they haven't signed up for an on exchange plan like that open enrollment is closed. I haven't seen anything that has said they've extended it. Okay. But if they already have an on exchange plan they can still port it over. \nChristian:\nOkay. \nNic Paul:\nBring your own plan and have we sent you those docs? \nmessengd:\nNo, I I might need them again if you could resend them that'd be awesome. Yeah, I'm scheduling a call with them early next week, like Monday or Tuesday. I was gonna try and bring one of you, one of you two on one of you three on now if possible. Just so you know, really haven't gone through that many situations like that yet. I think I've only done it once and I just wanna make sure I don't mess anything up, Truth be told. Likewise, I, I think that there's so many great plans on that. I will say the New York market sucks. That's just New York. Like New York just sucks. There's nothing you guys can do about it Unfortunately. \nNic Paul:\nI hear you. \nChristian:\nI don't know how to do that. I gotta hop off. Zach, can you send over an email so I can start CCing you on things? \nZach Laurer:\nYeah, for sure. Catch you that right now. Alright, thanks guys. \nChristian:\nI'll, I'll catch you guys soon. Awesome. Thanks. \nmessengd:\nKeep it up man. \nNic Paul:\nKilling it. \nTonya Salter:\nYeah. \nChristian:\nDevin. \nNic Paul:\nYeah, sorry, I know we're coming up on time. \nmessengd:\nAnything else may you're with or No, that's all I'll get that. I'm gonna, I've been talking with the client, I'm gonna get you guys an email like you know how we've been doing it with telling you what day and time, see if that works for either of you and then go from there. Okay. \nNic Paul:\nI'm sending over that bringing, bring your own plan stuff right now, so Perfect, perfect, perfect. So We have both a link online and then also a guide, so I'll send you both. \nmessengd:\nPerfect, perfect, perfect. Thank you so much. I try to push the, that card, I'm like it's so much easier. They're like, nah, I want that full integration Damnit. I'm like the, that card that it's like, you know, they can use it for anything like, well not anything, you know what I mean? Like medical expense related but she didn't like that option. She was like, well can we fully bring it in so the payroll's done automatically. I was like, yeah we can, I was like that process just takes a little bit longer so. Alright, cool. Alright cool. I'll connect with her, try and get you guys a day and time and we'll go from there. Awesome. \nTonya Salter:\nGood. Thanks Evan. Thank you Evan. \nmessengd:\nGreat day. \n",

Key Updates / Progress\n- Integration Setup Completed: Successfully connected Workday test environment (RH1 tenant) to Thatch demo account using ISU credentials\n- System Account Created: Deloitte created ISU (Integration System User) account in Workday with necessary security permissions\n- Security Permissions Added: Added required domains including \"Get Access to Worker Data,\" \"Manage Organization Integration,\" and \"Private Work Email Integration\"\n- Connection Validated: Integration successfully authenticated and connected\n- Payroll Schedule Configured: Set biweekly pay schedule with Friday paydays (no adjustment for holidays as direct deposit processes automatically)\n- Data Staging in Progress: Deloitte team working to create fictitious employee data in test tenant by end of week (December 20, 2025)\n- Current Blocker: No employee data currently exists in test environment for validation\n\n3. Client Input / Feedback\n- Open Enrollment Timeline Clarification: Sarah Kee indicated original plan was to conduct March 1, 2026 open enrollment on paper, manually entering data into Workday post-go-live\n- Preference for Workday-Based Enrollment: Team agreed it would be cleaner to conduct open enrollment directly in Workday if production environment is ready\n- Adjusted Open Enrollment Window: If using Workday, Sarah prefers opening enrollment on Friday, February 27, 2026 (instead of Sunday, March 1) and closing by March 15, 2026\n- Email Preference: Brad O'Neill noted that personal email addresses are preferred over work emails for ICHRA transitions\n- Employee ID Format: Sarah confirmed need for 3-digit employee IDs with padded zeros (001-999 range expected)\n\n4. Action Items\n- [Alia/Thatch] → Send email with required employee data fields for test scenarios → December 17, 2025\n- [Raghav/Deloitte] → Create fictitious employee data in Workday test tenant with specified fields → December 20, 2025\n- [Raghav/Deloitte] → Notify Thatch team when employee data is staged for validation → December 20, 2025\n- [Alia/Thatch] → Provide sample deduction report in EIB format → December 20, 2025\n- [Raghav/Deloitte] → Conduct hire, job change, and termination test scenarios during Agnelis's staffing tests → Week of January 5, 2026\n- [Stefan/Risant] → Schedule follow-up meeting for end-to-end testing results → January 21, 2026, 1:30-2:30 PM\n- [Raghav/Deloitte] → Plan production tenant cutover for week of February 23, 2026 to enable March open enrollment → February 23, 2026\n- [Nicole O'Neill] → Adjust plan document dates for compliance if enrollment starts February 27 vs March 1 → TBD\n- [Sarah Kee/Risant] → Finalize funding approach before communicating ICHRA changes to employees → TBD\n- [Michael Han] → Create implementation timeline with key communication dates → TBD\n\n5. Notes\n- Integration Sync Frequency: Workday syncs to Thatch every 24 hours after initial full sync\n- Testing Approach: Two-phase testing planned:\n  - Unit testing (current phase): Validate connection and data pull\n  - End-to-end testing (January 2026): Test hire, promotion, termination scenarios with 10-15 test cases\n- Data Validation: Thatch account provides visibility into synced employee data; team can validate demographic information directly\n- Deduction File Process: Thatch will generate deduction reports; Deloitte will load into Workday via EIB template\n- Production Cutover Considerations: Production environment must be ready by February 27, 2026 to support open enrollment starting that date\n- Go-Live Date: April 1, 2026 for benefits effective date\n- All-Employee Workday Go-Live: March 2, 2026\n- Compliance Requirement: 90-day advance notice to employees required\n- Current Workday Version: 45.1\n- Tenant Details: Risant Health will have dedicated Workday instance separate from Kaiser Permanente; single legal entity for all Risant employees\n\nGranola Summary\n\nObjectives So Far:\n- Establish Workday-to-Thatch integration for ICHRA benefits administration\n- Validate data synchronization between systems\n- Plan and execute comprehensive testing strategy (unit and end-to-end)\n- Ensure production readiness for March 2026 open enrollment\n\nProgress Made:\n- Successfully connected Workday test environment to Thatch using ISU credentials\n- Configured security permissions and integration settings\n- Established biweekly payroll schedule in Thatch\n- Defined required employee data fields for testing\n- Aligned on testing approach (unit testing followed by scenario-based end-to-end testing)\n- Clarified open enrollment timeline and production cutover requirements\n\nOutstanding Issues:\n- No employee data currently exists in test environment for validation\n- EIB template format compatibility needs confirmation from Thatch product team\n- Funding approach must be finalized before employee communications begin\n- Production tenant cutover timeline needs detailed planning to meet February 27, 2026 target\n\nNext Steps:\n- Thatch to provide list of required employee data fields (December 17, 2025)\n- Deloitte to create fictitious employee data in test tenant (by December 20, 2025)\n- Thatch to provide sample deduction report (by December 20, 2025)\n- Conduct end-to-end testing with hire/change/termination scenarios (January 5-19, 2026)\n- Review testing results in follow-up meeting (January 21, 2026)\n- Plan production cutover for week of February 23, 2026\n- Finalize compliance documentation and employee communications timeline"

Critical Timeline Adjustment - Open Enrollment\nMajor Decision: Open enrollment will be conducted in Workday (not on paper as originally planned)\n- Original plan: March 1, 2025 (Saturday) start date with paper enrollment\n- Revised approach: Open enrollment Friday, February 27, 2025 (or February 28)\n- Enrollment window: Approximately 2 weeks, ending by March 15, 2025\n- Benefits effective date: April 1, 2025 (unchanged)\n- Critical dependency: Workday production tenant must be ready and connected to Thatch by week of February 23, 2025\n- All-employee Workday go-live: March 2, 2025\n\n6. Compliance Considerations\n- Plan documents must be adjusted to reflect February offer date (instead of March 1) for April 1 effective date\n- 90-day advance notice to employees required\n- Communication strategy: Waiting to finalize funding approach before socializing ICHRA changes to employees\n\nStakeholders Identified\n\nRisant Health (Customer/Employer)\n- Sarah Kee: Primary contact, decision-maker on enrollment dates and payroll configuration\n- Will Calderwood: Project oversight, timeline coordination\n- Stefan V. Jarmusz: Meeting coordination, project management\n\nDeloitte (Implementation Partner)\n- Raghav Vasudevan: Lead technical consultant, Workday configuration, testing coordination\n- Premanand Kumar (Prem): Technical setup, ISU configuration, testing strategy\n- Sonya Unger: Data staging, employee setup in test environment\n- Agnelis: (Referenced) Conducting staffing test scenarios, open enrollment planning\n\nThatch (Vendor/Platform Provider)\n- Alia Gurtov: Technical integration specialist, led setup walkthrough, primary technical contact\n- Jared: Thatch team member (limited participation)\n\nO'Neill Group (Benefits Compliance)\n- Nicole O'Neill: Compliance oversight, plan document adjustments\n- Brad O'Neill: Implementation timeline coordination, compliance requirements\n- Michael Han: Implementation timeline documentation\n\nImportant Milestones & Timestamps\n\n| Date/Timeframe | Milestone | Status |\n|----------------|-----------|--------|\n| December 16, 2025 | Workday test environment connected to Thatch | ✅ Completed |\n| End of week (Dec 20, 2025) | Fictitious employee data created in RH1 tenant | In Progress |\n| Week of January 5-12, 2025 | Bulk of test data creation, staffing scenarios begin | Planned |\n| Week of January 19, 2025 | End-to-end integration testing phase | Planned |\n| January 21, 2025, 1:30-2:30 PM | Testing results review meeting | Scheduled |\n| Week of February 23, 2025 | Production tenant cutover must be completed | Critical Deadline |\n| February 27-28, 2025 | Open enrollment begins in Workday production | Target Date |\n| March 2, 2025 | All-employee Workday go-live | Planned |\n| March 15, 2025 | Open enrollment ends | Target Date |\n| April 1, 2025 | Benefits effective date | Confirmed |\n\nNext Steps with Deadlines and Responsible Parties\n\nImmediate Actions (By December 20, 2025)\n1. Alia (Thatch): Send email with complete list of required employee data fields for testing\n2. Raghav/Sonya (Deloitte): Create fictitious employee data in RH1 tenant with proper employee ID format (001, 002, etc.)\n3.

            "transcript": "Sarah Kee (Risant Health):\nHi. Hi. How is everyone? \nNicole O'Neill:\nHey. \nAlia from Thatch:\nHey. \nSarah Kee (Risant Health):\nIt is cold here. \nNicole O'Neill:\nIt's cold. How cold is cold? \nSarah Kee (Risant Health):\nWell, it says it's 37 degrees. \nNicole O'Neill:\nThat is cold. \nSarah Kee (Risant Health):\nIt feels colder than that and last night it was 20 and with the wind chill, I think it was 7. \nNicole O'Neill:\nOh my gosh, yeah. We're expecting big winter this year in Colorado, this week in Colorado. So, oh well, where's the snow and the snowflakes and the holiday spirit? \nSarah Kee (Risant Health):\nWe had it actually, we had snow over the weekend and it's been so cold, it's still lingering here. But I won't talk about cold with Will on here. \nNicole O'Neill:\nBecause I'm sure whatever Chicago's going through is, yeah, right, uh, we're. \nWill Calderwood (Risant Health):\nWe're in the middle of a heat wave, it's like 35 degrees or something today. \nSarah Kee (Risant Health):\nPeople in short, me, you know, there are some people out there in shorts and birkenstocks with socks. \nWill Calderwood (Risant Health):\nI thought somebody wearing shorts yesterday when I was like, nine degrees and I was like, What is wrong with you? \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nYeah, that is crazy. \nJared (Thatch):\nIt's brave, nice to see everybody. \nUnger, Sonya:\nSorry, I'm the only slacker, but I'm not camera ready. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nNo worries, Sonia. \nJared (Thatch):\nDo we have everybody from Deloitte and Ryzen? \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nThe Deloitte team, yeah. \nWill Calderwood (Risant Health):\nYeah, Stefan said he'd be a couple minutes late, so he should be on here in a minute, But I'm going to start the transcription here for him in case, unless there are any objections. \nSarah Kee (Risant Health):\nYep, good to go, okay. \nKumar, Premanand:\nUh, yeah, I think, uh, Stefan set this up, uh, for us to talk about, like doing some unit testing primarily. Uh. So, just to give an update from a workday perspective, we have set up the account, the system account, or what we call as the ISU. We are ready to share the credentials with the Thaats team here. Raghav and Sonia are trying to create some data. Currently, we don't have any data in our test environment. So they are trying to get some employees set up in the tenant. And Raghav, Sonia, please. Keep me honest here, but I think we are trying to get some data created by end of this week. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nYeah, that's right. And I think, so just to give everybody a little bit of context, we're doing our first prototype build of the workday tenant right now. So getting all of our initial config in against what Sarah and Agnelli have provided us with requirements. I think one question that we did have on unit testing and Prem, you might. You might be getting to this as well, is just whether there are any sort of like specific parameters or data elements that you would like for us to populate. For any fictitious employees that we create in order to help facilitate, like any sort of like specific test scenarios that you have. \nAlia from Thatch:\nYeah, absolutely. So I can talk us through those fields. One thing that, uh, we can definitely do on the call today as well, is if you, if you have the ISU, we can actually connect to a test production account. Um, so, at least that's there. And then when you have data that can populate, we should see that sync within 24 hours. So you let us know that that's happened, we'll take a look, see what's come through. Um, in terms of the parameters I can send over, uh, it's really just like the basics. Um, as much data as you are able to populate, the better. So even if it's just, I think, like, placeholder nonsense for a lot of it. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nYeah, but just putting something in there. \nAlia from Thatch:\nYeah. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nAre you saying that mostly around like personal information, like, I don't know, demographic details or things like that? Or is it beyond that? \nAlia from Thatch:\nNo, mostly it'll be things like the stuff that we always try to collect would be first name, last name, personal email, work email. As available, we need at least one of those. Um, start date, employment type, pay type. Uh, I like employee ID. um, if there's a secondary employee ID that's used, um, we'd like that as well. Phone number, job title, yearly pay are useful but not necessary. And you don't have to remember all that. I'll send it over, but that's, that's kind of the shape of the stuff, um, and we'd especially be keen to see what the employee ID is. Looks like. So what, that format. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nLike the format? \nAlia from Thatch:\nYeah. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nOkay. Yeah. And Sarah will keep me honest. I don't think we're planning to change the format of employee IDs with the move to Work day. \nSarah Kee (Risant Health):\nHonestly, we haven't had that conversation. And I think that anticipating future state, we should probably make it a three digit. So do we need to build it so that we are passing a certain number of digits so that we have like, 001, 002? I don't see us going over 999 employees. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nSo yeah, we've got, um, we've got like padded zeros in workday to to do that. So, yeah, I, um, yeah, it would be zero, zero one, zero, zero two. Uh, all the way to nine, ninety nine, yeah, yeah, okay, um, yeah. So we can definitely make sure that, um, that that sequence is set up before, um, before we, uh, share, uh, before we, um, before we stage employees. \nSarah Kee (Risant Health):\nYeah, um. \nAlia from Thatch:\nAnd then in terms of how you're building out the workday integration more broadly? Um, will Ryzen be on its own company code, distinct from perhaps any other, uh, entities? \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nOkay, yes, yeah, if I assume you're kind of asking that in the context of like, different from like Kaiser permanente, um, but yes, Ryzen will be in its own like. Workday instance, there will be, like, a, you know, a Ryzen specific legal entity that every employee is assigned to. Is that what you mean by company code, Aaliyah? Or is that you thinking about something else? \nAlia from Thatch:\nNo, I think so. Not so much the legal entity, but in terms of how they are, and I probably might be using the wrong terms here, But just ensuring that whatever we connect, like, wouldn't have the possibility of pulling in data from. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nOh, certainly, from like another organization. No, certainly, yeah. Ryzen is on their own in this workday tenant. Yeah. \nAlia from Thatch:\nAnd that's the case in production once you get there. For sure, yes. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nYeah. There may be something that changes with that down the road, specifically with learning. But the additional population who may come into workday at that point would not be employees. Um, they would, they would have separate personas in workday as learners, So I don't think they would come over on any of the polls that you would be doing. \nAlia from Thatch:\nOkay, all right. Well, in that case, my pitch would be, let's get set up. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nTry to connect. \nAlia from Thatch:\nAll right, so instead of having you give us the credentials, what I'm going to do is put it into that demo Thatch account. Here is a link to it. If, if, if you're up for it, if you want to click that link and share your screen, do you mind doing this? \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nSince I think you have the credentials. \nKumar, Premanand:\nYeah, I sorry. But but again, I think just to make sure like we're on the same page. As as Raghav was saying, we don't have data in the tenant right now. Elliot so. Meaning, I mean, once you connect to the tenant, you'll not be able to, you know, get any responses. So you have like zero data in the tenant. So just want to make sure like you're aware of that. \nAlia from Thatch:\nYeah, I understand. I guess my thought is, since we're here together, we might as well get the connection in place, assuming it'll still work without data. And then you let us know when it should populate and we'll keep an eye on it. \nKumar, Premanand:\nGot it. \nAlia from Thatch:\nOtherwise, we... Probably want to meet again to do this. \nKumar, Premanand:\nSo, yeah, uh, I just wanted to make sure, like, uh, when you do the test, you're not going to get any employees back. So, uh, no, you know, so I I clicked on the link that you just put in the chat window. Uh, let me know. Yep, that looks good. \nAlia from Thatch:\nUm, feel free to maybe, if you want to do that part privately and then re-share that. Totally understand. Um, is this this? \nKumar, Premanand:\nSo this one? The email address and the password is is for Ryzen to create, like a uh, to sign up to Thatch, or like, what is the email ID and password here? \nAlia from Thatch:\nSo, yes, so. In the future, when we do this with a real Thatch account, it would be like every admin on Ryzen's Thatch account would have their own email and login option. For the moment, you know, we just kind of need to get a test version set up, but it is in a production space, So we're not going to add a bank account or do any of the other details this flow will prompt you to do. But yeah, so you're getting a preview of what the employer setup will be in the future. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nSo this is not, right here, we're not putting in, like the ISU credentials. This is us putting like our, like this is like pram, putting in like an ID. \nAlia from Thatch:\nGot it. I see. I understand. Sorry, I misunderstood. Yeah. So this is just email and password for the Thatch account. So not the workday information yet. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nNot the integration account. Okay. \nAlia from Thatch:\nOkay, yeah, if you think about it, there's, um, there's. There's the Thatch account, which is where all the administration happens, and then you connect Workday Yeah to the Thatch account. Okay, Okay, and we'll just go ahead and click the purple button to move through this. Because we're never going to get to the point where we're doing any, you know, KYB or any other authentication like this. It really will just be about the payroll connection. You can see I put in a bunch of dummy information here. \nKumar, Premanand:\nOkay. \nAlia from Thatch:\nSo you can click next. \nKumar, Premanand:\nYep. \nAlia from Thatch:\nAll right. So go ahead and type in workday. And we'll use the credentials. \nKumar, Premanand:\nOh yeah, that's my credentials. Is the ISU that you want us to plug in, right? \nAlia from Thatch:\nYes, yeah. So this should look fairly familiar from from the flow that you were reviewing in the merge instructions there. \nKumar, Premanand:\nYep, give me one second, I'm just gonna pull up the the details here. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nGraham, do you need help grabbing that URL? \nKumar, Premanand:\nno. I have it already. Okay. OK, this way to connect. OK, rather, if you can do a small so that if you log into the tenant and check the. I was not sure from Sushant's email if this was an underscore. If you don't mind checking the exact name. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nYou have it, right. Actually, I actually sorry. No, there's a little bit more in the, I'll put it in the chat, in the username. It's after underscore demographic, it's underscore data, underscore API, underscore outbound. And then, if we need to, I can also change the password if that doesn't work. \nKumar, Premanand:\nIs this underscore? \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nIt is. It's ISU underscore Int. 004. Yeah. Underscore that, underscore demographic, underscore data, underscore API, underscore outbound. Yeah. Change the password. Yeah. Let me change the password and I'll ping you separately with that. \nKumar, Premanand:\nAnd quick question to Alia. Is there a version specific API? Meaning, I mean, so currently we are on 45.1 in terms of the endpoint. So do we need to tweak the version to what that has? \nAlia from Thatch:\nNo. So we're working directly with what Merge is providing us. So anything that that they've specified is how we're integrating. \nKumar, Premanand:\nSo you're good with the latest version? \nAlia from Thatch:\nIt should be. \nKumar, Premanand:\nOkay, let's try this password. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nAnd the other thing I'm seeing, I'm not sure that this ISSG actually has the domains it needs. Although this is saying credentials, so I don't know that that would be the issue. \nKumar, Premanand:\nPretty sure it has the credentials. Is is it an other ISU that you're seeing? \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nUm, no, there's no other ISU. I'm just, uh, I'm just looking at the ISSG that was created for this and it doesn't have domains on it yet. \nKumar, Premanand:\nOkay, do you want to share your screen? \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nYeah, sure, so, uh. Once this comes up, the the ISSG is there, but I don't see any domain permissions associated to it. So I think we may need to add those still. I mean, I can do that right now, because I think those instructions were on the link that Aliyah shared. \nKumar, Premanand:\nYeah. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nActually. Sign up as well real quick. \nAlia from Thatch:\nAh, it may would not work for me, let's give it a shot. It may not. But um, we can work around it to get you added to the account. If not interesting, okay, same dummy data. So I think we're fine. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nYeah, we'll take it. \nKumar, Premanand:\nSo, Raghav, we don't need to do this. I think we can directly go into Workday, right? So just go into Workday, and let's actually add a couple of these permissions and retry. Yeah. So, let me... \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nWhere are the permissions on the next page? No, they're not. \nKumar, Premanand:\nNo, no, no. You can directly go into the workday tenant and just do a related action. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nYeah, maintain security permissions. \nKumar, Premanand:\nYeah, I'm meeting security permissions. And add the UM, add get access to worker data, public worker reports, yep, and then add Manage Organization integration, uh, and then add a private work email integration, Uh. Subdomain. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nOne second, I can add it, just like the period from the domain, just just add the parent. \nKumar, Premanand:\nFor now, that's fine. I mean, just just do email for now. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nOh okay, sorry. Was that meant to be, um, home or work email book? \nKumar, Premanand:\nYeah, hey, Sarah. \nNicole O'Neill:\nOne of the things just so you know that in will be common in Ichra is that traditionally, we like to have the employee's personal email for transition. So however, you guys working and just want to let you know that. That's why a lot of times we use their personal versus their work emails. \nAlia from Thatch:\nAll right. \nKumar, Premanand:\nHey, it actually said success now. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nOh, wow. \nKumar, Premanand:\nNice. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nOkay. \nKumar, Premanand:\nYeah, and it went to this page after it said success. It said We need more information about your payroll setup. \nAlia from Thatch:\nAnd none of this matters anymore. \nKumar, Premanand:\nSo we're actually done. \nAlia from Thatch:\nSo you can save and sign out. And then, you know, for Sarah, Will, in the future, These are all things that we would set up together on the actual account that we use. \nKumar, Premanand:\nAnd yeah, so. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nDo we need to set that up still in the test environment, though, in order to, like, do any subsequent testing? \nAlia from Thatch:\nWell, I don't believe we're going to be at a place where we would end up calculating any deduction reports or anything for these folks. We could, like, we could just throw some biweekly on there. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nIf it makes more sense to do it as part of our actual end-to-end testing phase, that's totally fine. I just wanted to make sure you guys have what you need in order to actually see if worker data is coming over. \nAlia from Thatch:\nIt won't impact that, but you know what? Maybe there's something we want to test later, so might as well. \nKumar, Premanand:\nOkay, if I understand correctly, so you need the payroll information, I mean to, to. You're going to grab all the demographics data from workday and then you're going to, you know, uh, you need to send back, you know, um, data back to payroll system. That's where I think you need some of this. Is it, right? Alia? \nAlia from Thatch:\nSo these are, yeah, the workday connection is right is read only, um, currently. So, so what we would end up doing is generating deduction reports, um, based on this, right? \nKumar, Premanand:\nSo you need this basically to create your deduction reports. What, what? what are you saying? \nAlia from Thatch:\nYeah, otherwise, we default to monthly. \nKumar, Premanand:\nOkay, sounds good. yeah, okay, so are. Do we want to just leave it as is? \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nYeah, sounds like it? \nAlia from Thatch:\nSo you can do the save and sign out thing in the bottom right corner. And basically, we just kind of sit tight until, and I can always come in and add a pay schedule later. So we just sit tight until we've got some data to look at. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nCool. Then we'll send you guys a note as soon as we've got some employees created in the tenant. And I think, Aliyah, I took a note of of the fields that you were saying you wanted to have filled out. But if you could send an email just for confirmation, um, that'd be helpful for me. Um, but yeah, we'll. We'll send a spreadsheet over with, uh, some details of, like, the fake employees that we've created. Um, and then you can validate that. Um, it's pulling, oh perfect. \nAlia from Thatch:\nYeah, that'd be great, um, and looking on our back end here, oh yep, payroll's connected. Okay, just had to refresh. Yes, so that sounds good. I'll get you guys in the email with, um, it might take me just a minute because I I want to check. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nOh, that's fine. \nAlia from Thatch:\nYeah, yeah. Whether there's other fields, they they want us to populate, if possible. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nUm, yeah, no worries. Yeah, even if, even if that comes like tomorrow morning, that's totally fine. We'll, um, if if we do get started with staging today, um, we can always add more details, um, after you share, uh, any additional fields with us, all right. That is great. I appreciate you walking us through that, Aaliyah. As we get closer to our actual end-to-end testing phase, which is scheduled to take place during the month of January, obviously we are going to conduct test scenarios directly in Workday. Are there additional scenarios or additional connectivity that needs to be tested when we get to that phase beyond just... You know, pulling worker demographic data, would we want to then practice? Like, you know, getting the deductions from you guys? And uh, and loading that back into workday, doing some sort of like, would it be possible to do like, some sort of like? Fictitious benefits enrollment in a in a test environment with batch and just like, pull that as like a deduction and and load it into workday and see how all of that works. \nAlia from Thatch:\nUm, probably not properly through the product. So what I would do is just prepare, prepare. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nyeah, just prepare a file. Okay, yeah, fair enough. \nAlia from Thatch:\nYeah, so when in January are you thinking you'd want to do that? Just rough estimate. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nYeah, for that piece specifically, I'd probably be looking at like the third week of January. So the week of January 19th would be sufficient, I think, for that. \nAlia from Thatch:\nOkay, so I think ahead of that, and so maybe I just do this now, what is the deduction schedule? \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nSo it looks, Actually, it's biweekly, biweekly. \nAlia from Thatch:\nAnd if there's a holiday or weekend, is it paid right before or right after? \nSarah Kee (Risant Health):\nSarah, if it's a holiday and it's a weekend, it is Friday, right? It is Friday. \nAlia from Thatch:\nSo would you pay on a Thursday instead, or would you wait till the next Monday if Friday was out? Holiday for some reason? yeah, weekend is irrelevant. Sorry, I don't know why I said that. Um, and also it doesn't really matter, just it doesn't. \nSarah Kee (Risant Health):\nIf it's set up in direct deposit, doesn't it still just pay? \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nIt still just pays. \nSarah Kee (Risant Health):\nI've never had that question because it just pays, even if it's a holiday. \nAlia from Thatch:\nOkay, I will take a note of that. \nSarah Kee (Risant Health):\nOkay, that's what I was like, um, never had, because it's just automated. Like, we would change when we would process payroll. Because if we were going to be closed, we might run our payroll on a different date. But the payday is always Friday because we would just modify our timing to push it. \nAlia from Thatch:\nOkay. And actually, all the schedule really does is say, oh, maybe we give it to you a day early if there's a holiday. So we'll set it up for that. And we can always take a look and see if it makes sense later. Yeah, it's just going to generate one day early in that case. \nSarah Kee (Risant Health):\nOkay, that's fine. We keep it to Friday. \nAlia from Thatch:\nOkay, sounds good. \nStefan V. Jarmusz (Risant Health):\nFor that third week, Wednesday, January 21st, looking at calendars, I mean, they're pretty open right now, but wanted to propose 1.30 to 2.30. Maybe I set up a placeholder on our calendars for that time. \nAlia from Thatch:\nYeah. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nSo I think we've shared the template already for deductions. I don't know that. We necessarily need a phone call to facilitate that, beyond just Aliyah, giving us a sample set of deductions. So I think, regardless, though, Stefan, to your point, it's probably still good for us to have a meeting to talk through results if there are things for follow-up. I think that time works for us. We can definitely accommodate that on the delay team. Yeah, I think that would be fine. \nStefan V. Jarmusz (Risant Health):\nJust hearing a bit. And the outcome of that call, or the goal of that call, is. To talk through results of the integration testing. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nYeah, I would like to. Well, of the deduction file. Because the integration itself, like once, honestly, like, I guess like this is the thing that I'm a little unsure of. So actually, maybe just keep me honest. But like, once you guys have confirmed that you are able to pull the data that you need from workday. And you actually see those like staged employees. Even as early as this week in there. Is there anything else that you guys need to test from an integration standpoint? \nAlia from Thatch:\nNo. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nOkay. So we would do that again, definitely in each environment that we move to over the course of the implementation. But I guess, Prem, go ahead, please. \nKumar, Premanand:\nWhat I was going to say is, if you break this into two parts, right, and Alia, keep me honest. here, what we're trying to test now is more like a unit test. Right, to make sure that the environments are connected that is able to, you know, um, connect to workday and then retrieve the information. What you want to test in your end-to-end testing is like scenarios like like, hire an employee in, Um in, hire a new employee in Ryzen. Make sure that the the new hire actually makes its way to Thatch. You're able to, you know, do whatever needs to be done there, right? Similarly, you would do a change job, like, promote an employee. And make sure that the new job title, the new location or whatever, the new details of the promotion actually reflects there in that. So, and similarly, so, so you would want to test some of those scenarios? To make sure that the new information that's been updated in Workday actually made its way to that. And that's what you want to do in that week of 19th, or whenever. Right. So in January to test these ballpark like 10 to. 15 scenarios to make sure that. When you hire an employee, we can confidently say that the new employee has been consumed by that. And made its way there. And the tax team can, And I don't know whether you produce some kind of a validation report. For Sarah and others to say, yeah, this information looks good. Or whether you would, you know, somebody would need to spot check some of the key attributes of the employee. To say, yeah, the new hire has this job title in workday. Has the same job title in Um, in in touch, has the same whatever in in workday. So you want to be able to compare some of the key attributes between both the systems. To say, you know, yes, it is matching and everything is working as expected. So I think you want to basically drill down to one level of detail during that week of 19th. Uh, you know, to make sure that some of these key scenarios and the data attributes that are exchanged between the systems actually work as expected. \nAlia from Thatch:\nYeah, this makes a lot of sense. So now that you have this account, um, and I'm, I'm happy to, of course, like, be your partner. In kind of validating what we're seeing on our end. Um, your data is going to start showing up here and so you'll you'll have access to also see whether it's coming. We can check ourselves. Yeah, but I mean, to the greatest extent that you would like to like, please let me know what, what you need, what you're looking for. Um, so we can kind of, like, stay in lockstep with you. But yeah, the good news is you'll, you'll have a lot of visibility. What you won't see is a lot of the like we aren't showing, you know, many of the fields that that we're likely to get here. Um, so if there's something that you want to check, in some ways, a lot of stuff is just going to be metadata. That isn't needed by Thatch. But if you're curious about something that doesn't appear here, I can go look. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nOkay. Yeah, no, that is perfect. I think, Prem, those are good callouts on the types of testing we'd want to do. So kind of similar, honestly, to like the provisioning integration, where we would probably do like some hires, some job changes, and some terminations. To make sure that basically, the demographic list that we have in thatch is updating appropriately, based on each of those different process types. And then, yeah, Aaliyah, We'll work with you on validating any of the finer points in those details, in those data elements once those transactions get completed. And so that's something that we can actually even get started. Agnelis is going to be conducting staffing style test scenarios earlier than the third week of January itself. So I still think we can definitely meet the third week of January and kind of round out how all of that testing has been going. But I think in the meantime as well, Agnelis, Sarah, Sonia, We will have scenarios from an HCM perspective already to test, hire, and change job and termination. Those will also help facilitate some of this testing. And so we'll keep track of the transactions that we're putting in during the testing execution phase and validate that the right employees are coming into this list. \nKumar, Premanand:\nI also wanted to ask one quick thing here. In terms of, Alia, in terms of, do you envision doing, And I'm thinking, cut over here, right? Um, so I'm thinking, like, at Go Life. You will get all the employees from Ryzen Um in the workday system into thatch for the very first time, so you'll do like a full sync um from workday. Get them set up in thatch and then you will enable an incremental to to sync up. Any changes from that point onwards is that is that right? \nAlia from Thatch:\nYeah, so so we'll, um, probably as soon as we're ready. I think we'd want to get that account created, set up, connected, there's, you know what? For the real account, we also need to add a bank account and other details like that. Um, at that point we'll do, yes, one big sync that pulls in everybody, and then it syncs every 24 hours thereafter. Um, which is also something to keep in mind when you're when you're testing your scenarios. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nIt's doing our tests. Yeah, okay, um, yeah, and it'll show you when it lasts. \nAlia from Thatch:\nSank, saying, sinked, um, and when it's going to do that again. So you'll always have those, those dates as a point of reference. Timestamps. \nKumar, Premanand:\nOkay, so so where I was going with this is during testing. Do we know, like, when we'll be done with, like, the data loads? Like, are we using the same tenant for the end-to-end testing? \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nSorry, yeah, we're still, we're staying in the RH1 tenant for testing. And so, um, now that we're already connected like that, that piece should automatically kind of get facilitated. In terms in terms of the actual data frame, we are manually creating that data as we do our test scenarios, right? Because we're not using any production data. And so I think we'll have a lot of data created in the first two weeks, most likely like the week of January 5th and 12th. And then we'll supplement data in the subsequent weeks. The first time that we'd be using, like, you know, actual volumes of employee populations for Ryzen would be when we get to pay compare testing. But I don't think we would. We would have anything specific to do with the batch team during that period because we're more just comparing payroll cycles. I do have a question, Pram, that you triggered with the discussion around cutover. Sarah Agnelli's, Do we know when open enrollment is meant to start for employees? \nSarah Kee (Risant Health):\nMarch 1st. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nMarch 1st. Okay. And so we'll have the production tenant before then, because our all employee go live in workday is March 2nd. But we should have our production environment. We'll aim to have our production environment before the Monday, March 2nd, Because we would need to be doing a little bit of validation work before that anyway. And so I'll just take a note that open enrollment needs to be able to start on March 1st, which means that we need to have the production tenant ready in the week of the 23rd so that we can have that sync with that. And good call out that March 1st is a... \nAlia from Thatch:\nSaturday. Saturday. \nSarah Kee (Risant Health):\nSo we were planning to do it on paper, which is why we didn't think that we would be able to do this in workday. So if we're going to be able to do it on workday, then I need to shift my dates slightly. I wasn't anticipating that we'd be able to conduct this in workday, but that would be lovely. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nWell, I mean, that's how you're going to get your employee population. Sorry, Sonia, please go ahead. \nUnger, Sonya:\nNo, that's what I had thought as well. When we had talked about it before we got off and when we were like, Oh, no, we're doing a system, I was like, Okay, I didn't know when that had changed, but either way, we can figure it out. \nSarah Kee (Risant Health):\nAgnelis and I were operating under the assumption that we would be doing this on paper. And we would manually hard code these into workday because employees wouldn't be in there yet. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nOkay, so, um, I guess the thing the piece that I'm struggling with is, how do we get employees into Thatch if they're not in Workday, but if that think isn't already happening? \nSarah Kee (Risant Health):\nMy assumption here was that it would be something similar to what we did with D.C. Health. Link, where we provide the emails to Thatch and they send the link, like, we give a demographic file, that it was not being provided as a feed through this point yet, because this is pre-go live, yeah, and we we certainly can do, uh, upload and get everyone invited. \nAlia from Thatch:\nAnd then we would just sync work day later. And there might be some duplicates to double check, but um, our like duplicate handling is pretty, pretty good. \nSarah Kee (Risant Health):\nI'll take you all's advice on what's the better approach. You know, my expectation was never that we would be able to do open enrollment in March if we didn't go live until April. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nYeah. So I would love everyone's input on this. But from my perspective, I think it's cleaner if we are able to connect from workday production to that before that starts, because then this idea of duplicate management and having the right population doesn't even come into play if that's the case. \nWill Calderwood (Risant Health):\nI definitely think that's Plan A, if we can swing it. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nYeah. Okay. So this is definitely something that we need to consider as part of our cutover planning. Thatch team, Stefan and I will definitely keep you guys involved with that as, as we get a little bit more earnest in our cutover planning in January. And just kind of validate that the timelines and dates that we're putting out there are actually reachable for us. But we'll, we'll target, basically then. For the production tenant, our move to production basically will need to be during the week of February 23rd, so that we can connect to batch from the workday production environment that week itself. In advance of the March 1st open enrollment period. So that's helpful for me. I'll take that one away and we'll follow up on it. \nAlia from Thatch:\nAnd I might be speaking out of turn, Jared. Let me know if I'm wrong here. We might also have some flexibility in March. We just wanted to shift the enrollment window a little bit to before we're talking days. No. OK, Sarah, I see your face. Maybe not. OK, forget me. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nWell, I think, I mean, if everything's going to go live on April 1st, I think there is value to giving everybody that that full month if we're able to. Understanding that people are probably not logging in on a Sunday to do their benefit open enrollment. it. But, um, it'd be nice for them to have the option. All right. \nSarah Kee (Risant Health):\nI would probably then, if we were able to do that, I'd want to open it up on the Friday before. So people can start getting in there rather than shortening it and still have it end by March 15th. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nOkay. Yeah. We'll make that our goal. Yeah. As we get started on our. Tenant build timeline for Cutover. Make that our consideration, that we want the move to production to take place before Friday, that I think that's the 27th of February. \nNicole O'Neill:\nAnd then just keep me updated on those dates as you move through them. Because we'll need to adjust plan document dates to make sure that we meet the compliance of a February offer. Right to for one. So let's just just know I'm listening in the background and making the adjustments. But if we, if we do go like February 28th instead of March 1st, we need to make adjustments in the background for compliance, so which we can do. \nSarah Kee (Risant Health):\nThat won't have any impact on the actual start date, correct? It's still a 4-1 start? \nNicole O'Neill:\nCorrect. \nSarah Kee (Risant Health):\nOkay. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nOkay. \nNicole O'Neill:\nWhen are we going to start notifying the employees just so of these changes, Sarah, Just so I know, when are you going to start communicating? \nSarah Kee (Risant Health):\nSo we've begun socializing that we'll be moving to an ICRA. We need to finalize our funding approach first, because that will absolutely be the question that comes up. And I don't want to socialize this without that answer. \nNicole O'Neill:\nThat makes sense. Okay. \nNicole O'Neill:\nYou also mentioned that you're going to do a 90-day notice in advance. Maybe Michael will work on an implementation timeline so we can put some of those key factors in for us. \nHan, Michael:\nPerfect. That's all I had. \nNicole O'Neill:\nI just want to make sure that we keep those dates open. Let's not hide them amongst. The crowd because Michael and I and Brad will need to know those for the documents. But other than that, everything sounds great. Thank you all. \nWill Calderwood (Risant Health):\nDo we have any concerns with the EIB? I may have missed that. That would be the only other topic I had. \nAlia from Thatch:\nYeah. So I know you sent it over. I'm circling up with our product team now that we've got that template in hand. I don't know that we'd be able to. Put our report into that format, um, it's very, very like, specific to workday, but um, we're just going to see what we can do. And so let you know, yeah, keep us in the loop there. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nYeah, all right, and yeah, if if you guys do have questions on that EIB template, um, I'd like to like. If we can address those. Even before that, that third week of January, that would be great because I'd want to make sure that we're kind of all squared away from an operational standpoint as well. Like, Um, like, what? What that process looks like in terms of getting the UM deductions from you guys? And if there is any additional transformation that needs to happen? \nAlia from Thatch:\nBefore getting that into workday, yeah, I'm thinking I'd be able to give you like an example deduction report, probably like, end of week today. So yeah, you can, okay, at least have a sense of what's there by default. Okay, Well, thank you guys. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nThis has been really productive. I really appreciate everyone's partnership. \nAlia from Thatch:\nYeah. Good to see you all again. Thank you. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nThank you guys. Have a great one. \nKumar, Premanand:\nHave a good one. \nNicole O'Neill:\nHappy holidays. \nVasudevan, Raghav:\nBye. \n",

            "transcript": "Kaitlin Zidar:\nGood morning. Wait, try that again. Can you hear me? \nRetsy Holliday:\nIt's like, is it me? \nKaitlin Zidar:\nIs it you? I don't know. How are you doing? \nRetsy Holliday:\nI'm fine. Doing just fine. I did, I'll let this guy in a minute. I was paying Zach just about Medicare and he was like, there's a meeting literally today. I was like, I'm going to start World War III over this. We do not have adequate support for Medicare. And frankly, I don't know how we're supposed to scale up market if we don't. Because, like handling five Medicare eligible people versus handling 35 or 85 out of a thousand employees, like, it's going to be a whole new world for us. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nSo I don't know how we're doing that at Birds, but I'm pretty sure the broker took that on themselves. \nRetsy Holliday:\nWell, all right. I'm going to let you go in. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nIt was good foresight. Yes. Yes. I don't disagree with you one bit. \nRetsy Holliday:\nHey, Bryce. \nBryce Young:\nHey, how's it going? \nRetsy Holliday:\nGood. How are you doing? \nBryce Young:\nDoing so well. Thank you. Good. \nRetsy Holliday:\nGood. \nBryce Young:\nAre you all ready for the holidays? \nRetsy Holliday:\nOh, man. We are counting down. That's for sure. It's been a busy couple of, I would like to say, weeks, but it's really months. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nSo what about you? Are you excited for the holidays? \nBryce Young:\nOh, absolutely. Yeah. I'm going to fly from sunny Florida to snowy Utah. \nRetsy Holliday:\nAh. \nBryce Young:\nYeah. Roll around a bit in the snow, I guess. Fun. \nRetsy Holliday:\nIt'd be good. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nWhat's the place you're going to? \nBryce Young:\nOh, well, you know, I don't know if I'll actually get to do any skiing. Probably just throw some snowballs at the kids, but. \nRetsy Holliday:\nAll fun. I live in Breckenridge, Colorado. And it is like, really, it's crazy. It's the worst early winter we've ever had in the five years that I've lived here. There is no snow right now. So anybody, we have family visiting this upcoming weekend. And I was like, don't even, don't buy ski passes. Like, it's just not worth it. Oh, no. Yeah. Dang. \nBryce Young:\nWow. Yeah. I've only skied in Utah and Idaho, but I hear the skiing in Colorado is amazing. So that's a bummer. \nRetsy Holliday:\nIt is. We are very spoiled. I live 11 minutes from the base of Breckenridge and then have, like, you know, five other mountains within 45 minutes to 90 minutes. So very spoiled. \nBryce Young:\nThat is amazing. Yeah, you're in a good spot. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, yeah. It's a... It's a cool lifestyle until, you know, it snows and you can't get anywhere and the highway shut down. And everyone like, definitely, um, it is very cool, but you kind of forget that there are like, you know, it's hard to live in a place like this as well. So. \nBryce Young:\nOh, that's very fair. How about you, Caitlin? Getting any snow where you're at? \nKaitlin Zidar:\nI'm in Austin, so not really. Oh, not really. \nBryce Young:\nYour south is low. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nYeah. An inch would be a really big deal. Um, but no, I mean, it is getting chilly. It's in the 50s, so really haven't got room to complain. Nice. \nBryce Young:\nVery nice. That's cool. And hello, Sean. \nRetsy Holliday:\nHi, Sean. \nSean Hollis:\nGood day to everyone. Hello, hello. \nRetsy Holliday:\nThanks for joining us this morning. \nSean Hollis:\nOh, it's a pleasure. I wasn't going to miss this one. I'm looking forward to getting into how we can scale operations at NetRep. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOh, I love it. Um, I know we had a an army of folks on the invite I was looking at. We were doing a little bit of homework before we got on the call today. Are we? I mean, it looked like there was a couple paychecks reps that we're gonna join and a couple other team members from your guys side. Should we wait for them or should we get going here? \nBryce Young:\nI think we're good to kick off at this point since we're five after. But yeah, the hope was to get as many as we could, just to save some more conversations. But yeah, we'll see how this goes perfect. \nRetsy Holliday:\nUm, we're recording this as well. It looks like you guys have somebody recording. So we're always happy to share the recordings afterwards if that helps. So, in terms of our agenda today, kick off with a round of introductions. We'd love to just hear from you guys. Caitlin and I will start and then we'll hand it over to you. What brought you to Thatch? Obviously, Paychex brought you to Thatch. But what are the circumstances around your current benefits and rewards strategy? What's working? What's not working for you? So we'd love to hear a little bit more about that. And then I have some slides ready for us. It sounds like you guys have also done some of your own homework. So I'm sure you have your questions. We'll hit those and make sure that by the end of the call, we talk about kind of what next steps would look like if you guys are interested in moving forward. How does that sound? \nBryce Young:\nSounds great. Perfect. \nRetsy Holliday:\nAwesome. Well, I'm red C. Holliday. I'm your business advisor. So my job is really to support you guys through this evaluation process. Everything from, like, what is an ICRA? Who is that? Support you through the quote, build out the numbers. Do the numbers make sense for your team? Run you through a demo. At the end of the day, my job is to make sure that you have all of the data and the information that you need. To be able to make an informed decision on behalf of your team. And then I brought Caitlin here with me. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nAnd hi, I'm Caitlin. I'm the solutions consultant. I work closely with Retsy. I have been in the benefit space for over a decade. So I've spent my time across a few different roles. At one point, I was on the broker side and then have been with Thatch now for several months and excited to be here because I really do believe that Thatch is the future of benefits. So excited to show you more. And really, my role here is to make sure that you have a solid understanding as you're changing from group sponsor benefits to ECRA, which... Of course, administratively is a little bit different. So I really want to make sure you both are coming from a place of confidence. As you have internal meetings, as well as future meetings, that we are really here to support you. Wonderful. And then we'd love to hear from you a little bit about your roles and goals of today. \nBryce Young:\nOh, absolutely. Yeah, I'll kick us off. So yeah, Bryce, I run our HR side. And so I'm very much in the mix of our benefits. And, yeah, essentially what started this conversation was we have an employee out in New Mexico. And currently, with our benefits set up, I guess it won't cover her for some reason. And so we got the referral to Thatch from Todd and I believe Michael, we were talking with a little bit. But, yeah, we were interested to hear more about what all y'all provide. How that can scale over to New Mexico and other employees that we typically can't cover. Just, I guess, any other options you have, too. There's always some savings whenever it comes to benefits or ways that it can be better. So we're definitely open-minded. And I'll pass it over to Sean. \nSean Hollis:\nMuch. Thank you, Bryce. Director of Operations here. Nice to meet both of you, Caitlin and Retsi. It's, it's. It is an exciting time at Everputation. I'm part of the programs that are integrated together, the CRM, the document processor, the payment processor, but also paychecks. And I'm really interested to see, well, really to be in learning mode today. But, of course, we want to make sure that we are able to address and support all of our potential employees across the country. As we're looking to scale and expand for next year. Awesome. \nRetsy Holliday:\nThanks, Sean. Okay, so it sounds like you guys came to us because of this one unique employee in New Mexico. How would you say the rest of your benefits are working for the team? Are you guys generally happy with them? Are you seeing these like premium hikes year over year that everyone else is experiencing? So I guess, both on the employer and on the employee side, what is kind of the sentiment towards your benefits and rewards strategy today? \nBryce Young:\nJust to be candid, I mean. I feel like with where we're at in the market, we're doing okay. So, I mean, I came from a larger company where the benefits were maybe a third of the cost, right? But with where we're at and how we compare to those that are in a similar market, we're actually doing pretty well. We also just picked up an individual employee plan that we now fully cover, which has been great. I think that it's always unfortunate whenever prices go up. They did quite a bit this year. And so we're looking to save as well as much as we can, because we know that prices just seem to continue to go up. But yeah, I'd say we're kind of on the fence with happiness. It's something to where we see that things can be better, but also we know that it could be a lot worse. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nAnd what about your employees? I mean, I know you mentioned one outlier, but in... Do employees tend to also have that similar stance that they're doing okay? \nBryce Young:\nYou know, I haven't gotten a lot of sentiments just yet. I mean, it's been not really marketed too much with how we've run our benefits. There's actually a few people, even in our executive team, that didn't know that our employer was contributing to their benefits. And so, yeah, I'd say that there's definitely opportunity there. I've been in this role for just a few months now and so we're trying to connect all the dots. Make sure that everybody knows their employee value proposition, uh, their overall rewards. But we've got a long way to go. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nCompletely understand that. Total statements go a long way in reframing. It's way too common that I've heard from people. I didn't know how expensive health care was until they see the Cobra rates. I'm like, oh, you definitely weren't paying attention. \nBryce Young:\nThat makes sense. \nRetsy Holliday:\nWould you say that you guys are kind of using benefits and rewards today as a tool to attract and retain talent? \nBryce Young:\nNow we are. I will. Add that to the conversations that I have when recruiting, because, um, I mean, whenever we're, we're negotiating pay, I'm able to then say, like, yeah, well, We're also contributing like over 5,000 toward your benefits. And so, yeah, it's, it's part of that overall package. Right. But, but yeah, we, we weren't before. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOkay. Awesome. Cool. Um, I'm sure we have, Caitlin and I will have a couple more questions as we go through these slides. So please interrupt and ask us questions as well. But I want to make sure that we get through this in the next 10-ish minutes. So that we have some time here to talk about next steps as well. I think the only other thing in terms of timing, are you guys looking, what is the effective date that you're looking for? Is it the 1-1, a 2-1? \nBryce Young:\nGood question. I mean, so we are new, our new Mexico employee, that is new. Yeah. She has to sit kind of on the bench while we're deciding what's going to happen for her benefits. So we're hoping to figure something out very quickly. OK. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah. \nBryce Young:\nYeah. We just don't really know how this works for her because the open enrollment window is coming to a close. However, it's not her fault. So we don't really understand how all that comes together. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOK, perfect. All right, we'll talk about that, for sure here. We'll make sure we have some time to talk about timelines. Um, we do have time. We are, uh, we are. That window is is closing, but it has not closed. So, um, we can, and we can move fast. That's one of the benefits of working with Thatch. Um, so we'll talk about that here in a moment. Um, let me just share my screen and talk through a little bit more about that and who we are. Um, I always like to start with our mission, and that's because it is pretty unique. We are on a mission to build a healthcare system that people love. Um, you? I think we can probably all agree here that we've actually never had that in the U.S. Nobody says, I love my health insurance or I love the United States health care system. And so at Thatch, when we think about, like, what are those consumer experiences that we absolutely love and adore, It's sitting on your couch and ordering groceries to your front door with Amazon Prime. It's super easy. It's transparent. It's fast. It works almost every single time. And that's the kind of experience that we're trying to unlock for our members here on Thatch. What makes us a little bit different here, one of our biggest differentiators from other ICHRA vendors, is our fintech first approach. We are really driven by data science. We are not just a platform. So when our co-founders were thinking about how to actually deliver on that mission. To create a healthcare system that people love, we took a step back to evaluate, like, why people don't love this today. Like, why is... Signing up for your benefits such a painful process and kind of something that, to your point, Bryce, like most people, are kind of on autopilot. They don't even realize, like, what their employer is contributing. And the answer to that question is that there are typically transactional flaws within the health care system that make people really dislike it. It's whether or not your claim goes through or gets denied, and now you're fighting with the carrier over a ten thousand dollar bill. Or you think you have coverage and you show up for an appointment and for some reason you don't, and there's a lapse in coverage. These are all really complex issues to solve, and you can't solve them unless you start out as an infrastructure first company with the right foundation. So that we can actually scale and deliver the products that we're going to talk about here in a moment. So this infrastructure first approach has really set us up to deliver the best in class service model for all of our members. And what that means, from a member perspective and an employer perspective here is with that, you guys are going to define a budget, not the insurance policy. So as an employer, you no longer have to kind of wait for a renewal to come in. Year over year, brace for impact and really try to figure out, like, man, how am I going to make this work? As an employer, you're actually going to start to focus on your overall benefits and rewards package and the actual employee experience that you want to deliver. Versus manipulating those kind of group insurance levers like your deductibles, your premiums, your out-of-pocket maxes. Just to make sure that you can kind of swallow that renewal and make it work next year. Now, tactically, what this means is that you're going to give your employees a tax-free allowance, and they're going to have the freedom to go. Pick a plan that actually supports their own unique health journey. Once an employee opts into a medical plan, they're able to use any of the leftover money on qualified medical expenses. So if we're using our employee here, Sarah, she gets $750 in her allowance. She chooses a medical premium here that's $500, and she has $250 a month that she can go spend on qualified medical expenses. That could be prescriptions. It could be co-pays. It could also be on our marketplace, which we'll talk a little bit more about here in a moment. And so this right here is one of the most powerful things about that. It's the freedom to really personalize your own health care experience. You know, you could spend this on a therapist who doesn't take insurance or a physical therapist. So it really enables folks to come in and start to right size. They actually say, interesting, I don't need this Cadillac PPO plan. For me in particular, I worked at Google for five years. I was in my early 20s. I was on this really rich PPO plan, and I was highly overinsured. I barely used the plan at all. The company was paying a lot of money for me to be on that plan. And so what we're saying is that one-size-fits-all model actually ends up fitting no one. I'm going to pause here. This, at its very core, is what Thatch is doing. I'm going to go into how we come up with the dollar amount. Um, plan availability, carriers and talk a little bit more about that here next. But any questions just about, like the model in general, no questions just yet. Okay, awesome. So with that, um, there's a couple. There's two different ways that you can come up with this allowance amount, um, there's a flat allowance and a smart allowance. Our recommendation for groups of your size would be to do a smart allowance. And that's because we're going to benchmark off the age and the location of an individual. To ensure that we're creating a really fair allowance for every single employee and that they all have the same purchasing power. If you have a distributed workforce. And somebody is living in a more cost-effective rating area than somebody else, the person who lives in the more rich, more expensive rating area, San Francisco, is going to need more dollars to effectively go purchase the same plan. And so what we do here is we've built dynamic pricing into our tool to ensure there's really fairness across every single employee. So you guys tell me kind of what level of benefits you want to offer. We dynamically come up with the dollar amount by individual to ensure that everybody can go purchase that exact plan with a certain cost share. Now, of course, employees have the freedom to buy up or buy down. Right. That's kind of the beauty here. On average, we see about five different carriers and 20 different plan options to choose from. Again, all very dependent on location. But historically, what we're starting to observe with our members. Is that? Even when they have access to the same group plans that they have on the individual marketplace and their plans are actually identical, Employees start to actually move around and choose something different. And so what we're doing is we're putting power back into the employee's hands. Here to let them decide what network is best for them and their family. Now, I think the first thing when I say 20 different plan options, like, everyone's alarm bells go off, like, oh my gosh, my employees are not health insurance experts. How in the world are they going to navigate 20, 30, 40 different plan options, pick the right plan for them and their family. So with our tool, what we've done because we are that infrastructure first company, we've focused and put a lot of resources and investment into the platform itself. So kind of the first layer of support here is the actual platform. What you're looking at right now is a member shopping experience. Where they've entered their birth date, they've entered their location, and we start to surface the plans that are available to them. The first layer of support here is going to be the customizable bar across the top. So how much are you going to use this plan? You know, it could be a healthy 28-year-old on your team who goes to the doctor once a year. Like I was back in the day. And, you know, that person might say, I kind of want to buy down. So they're going to say, I only use this, you know, very little. Could be somebody who's family planning, and that means that their circumstances are going to need a different type of coverage. So we take that into account when we surface and recommend the right plan for this individual. The next one here is the Max contribution. How much do you want to contribute to your plan? And then the last one. Here is a provider search. And so your employees can actually input their provider's name. And, you know, for me, me personally, like when I had, I had 47 different options to choose from in Breckenridge, Colorado, From a plan perspective, when I input my doctor, that took me down to 23. So we're immediately kind of narrowing the funnel here in terms of options to help kind of hone in on what plan is going to be best for that individual. The second layer of support here is Thatchbop. So we have an AI chatbot on the site. As folks are going through enrollment, they can ask their real-time questions. What is a PPO? What is an HMO? What's the difference between a silver and a gold medal tier? Now, the third layer of support here is when your employee says, I would like help picking a plan. That is when we are actually going to bring in the human team. So we have a concierge team with bike glove service here that will meet one on one with any of your employees. Typically same day, if not within 24 hours. This time of year, a little bit busier. So it might be two or three days before they're able to grab time with that advisor. But the advisor is there. They're a localized advisor. And they're actually going to support them picking the right plan option. So they can come to that meeting and say, I'm on this prescription or my child has this condition. You know, these are the three plans that I'm looking at. Can you please help me pick the right plan for my family based on our circumstances and, you know, our specific preferences? All right. Any questions about that? \nBryce Young:\nSo just to make sure I understand it, it sounds like essentially you have the ability to scale to everybody's different states that they're in. And then they just pick plans based on the locality that they're associated with. \nRetsy Holliday:\nSpot on. Yep. \nBryce Young:\nThat's awesome. Okay. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah. All right. Real quick, I'm going to just touch on the marketplace here. Bryce, do you guys offer any sort of point solutions today? \nBryce Young:\nNo. I mean, we're looking at some options within Paychex, but tell us more. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah. So the marketplace here, this opens up a whole new world. So as a business, this means that, like once your employee does opt into a plan. And if they have $250, or they have $50 left over because they've decided to buy down, they can go. Use that money on qualified medical expenses, that, again, prescriptions, copays or on our marketplace. So we are, this is one of our biggest differentiators. We have some really cool partnerships here on the marketplace that are really exclusive. I'm actually going to get out of the deck here and let you guys look at, like, the real marketplace page for us. The cool thing about this is that once you guys start considering offering point solutions, like you offer the gym stipend, there's always going to be somebody who's like, I don't want the gym stipend. I want the mental health services, or I want access to GLP-1s. So this means that you guys don't have to stress about individual employees' requests for these specific one-off point solutions. You can actually offer a rewards package here that is unique and specific to every single one of your employees at no additional cost to you all. No, having to go, you know, contract with all of these different vendors and potentially have low utilization across each of these contracts. So just to highlight a couple, we have lyra health that's coming in 2026. This is super exciting. Typically, Lyra only contracts with very large vendors like the Googles of the world. So we're giving access to providers that historically, you know, an employer of your size would typically not have access to. Yep. I was sorry to interrupt. No, no, please. \nKaitlin Zidar:\nPart of why this is also so powerful is it's really putting preventative care in individual employees' hands and helping people with the appropriate behavior change. Because right now, part of the problem in health care, which you both probably know and are well aware, is with the fact that health care is tied to employment, the average person is staying at their employer for two years. So the carriers are not as incentivized to really invest in preventive care because it's for something that's a little bit more severe, chronic or acute condition, The insurer is doing that as spend that they'll see after the employee has moved on from the carrier. And so what part of this really is doing is supporting preventive care, meeting the employee where they are, but then also helping the individual. Where the carriers now have more incentive to be able to drive the interest of meeting, finding RETC out of. Getting ready to choose you out of the 30 plus options. So I just wanted to paint a little bit more of that picture. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, thank you, Caitlin. To the preventative care point here, Function Health. I don't know if you guys have heard of them, but they are very cool. They're coming up in the preventative health care space. I think they raised like 240 in their Series B recently. So they are really gaining a ton of market traction and they have all sorts of preventative health screening. You have your GLP-1 access through HIMS and HERS. Really like a whole, a massive amount of vendors here for your employees to come and have access to. So when it comes to like Bryce, that recruitment strategy, like this is one of the things that we could highlight. Is like, you know, not only are you getting X amount in your salary towards your contributions for your health insurance, you're actually going to be able to potentially unlock access to some of these really cool point solutions as well. All right, I'm going to just jump here to, lastly, what this looks like for you all from an administrative perspective. So we have an integration with Paychex, which is great, Meaning that we're going to upload your employee roster automatically. As you're hiring and as you're letting folks go. That's all going to be automated within our systems. We've really focused on making this as lightweight and seamless for your team as possible. So we're going to do all of the enrollments for every single employee. We're going to make all of the payments. Your employees are never putting down a personal card. We will do your ACA reporting, those 1094s and 1095s, and we can administer Cobra as well. So at the end of the day, what you guys should really experience with that is end-to-end compliance. All right. We have just five minutes here to kind of debrief, answer any questions. \nBryce Young:\nVery nice. All right. I mean, this sounds great. I mean, I like how everything can scale well, not only to different states, but personal circumstances. There's a lot of really cool perks in addition to what we would typically offer. Yeah, to your point with Lyra, That's something that I've utilized in the past with different employers, and I think that that's great, especially for families that have kids. Or just as life changes, it's really great to be able to offer that to different employees. And so now I would like to know a little bit more in terms of like, how you partner with paychecks, some of the cost, and then... Is this something to where you're hoping to roll it out to all the different employees, or are we able to just take care of Valeria for now? Or let us know what your thoughts are and how this all works. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, absolutely. So when it comes to the carve out, that is actually something that we can accommodate. Now, Caitlin, correct me if I'm wrong here. I believe geography does not have minimums. So, yes. So. The way that an Icra works, guys, is that there are 11 compliant classes. Where you can come in and carve up your employees and offer them different allowances, or potentially even offer one of your groups, like salaried, a group plan and your hourly employees. And they can actually be offered the ICRA. And so that's the only way that you could offer them side by side. And so geography is actually one of those classes. It's going to be the most common or full time, part time, hourly salary and geography. So if step one here was to just get your one employee taken care of in New Mexico, so that, you know, that person does have coverage. Heading into 2026, that is totally something that we could accommodate. \nBryce Young:\nOh, all right. That's cool. Yeah. Yeah. Cost wise. And then also how that integrates with paychecks. How, how does that look? Yes. \nRetsy Holliday:\nSo the pepum is a sixty eight dollar pepum, and that's going to be per enrolled employee. So you have one employee enroll. It's 68 bucks per month per that, you know, enrollment. The integration side of things. So, yes, we have a great relationship with Paychex. They're one of our biggest partners. And so we actually have an entire platforms team dedicated to Paychex relationships. And what that means is like, we have the most robust integration there. Are you guys Paychex Flex? \nBryce Young:\nYeah. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOkay, great. And so with Paychex Flex, we're going to automatically upload your employee roster into the portal. You're going to be able to invite folks. Through that portal. Like I had mentioned, if you're hiring somebody new, we're going to get notified because they're going to hit your payroll system. And then that integration usually comes through on our side within 24 hours. The same with letting somebody go. So if somebody is let go, we usually see that within 24 hours as they're terminated within the system. And you can invite them to participate with COBRA. And then, on the payroll deduction side, we do have automated deductions with Paychex Flex. Are you guys one Ein or multiple EINs? \nBryce Young:\nSo I believe, if I'm not mistaken, we're technically two. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOkay. \nSean Hollis:\nOrganizations, one EIN, I think, Bryce. \nBryce Young:\nOkay. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOkay, good. So like common ownership there, that just helps simplify. Sometimes I will say, if there are multiple EINs, the automated deduction piece and the automated employee rosters can get a little tricky. But if there is one EIN that helps simplify everything, then we will actually be able to do automated deduction. So an employee opts into a plan that is, you know, 50 bucks more than the allowance you're giving them. That will just automatically get taken out of their next paycheck. \nBryce Young:\nOh okay, interesting, all right. Um, yeah, and I know that we're about at time. And, yeah, Tommy hopped on. He, he's actually our inside counsel. Uh, Tommy, did you have any questions? Not sure how much you were able to catch from this. But this is for Valeria over in New Mexico. Our current offerings can't support her. \nTommy Meyer:\nYeah, that sounds good. Hey, Hey, Caitlin. Hey, Red C. How are you? Hi. \nRetsy Holliday:\nSo good. Thanks for joining. \nTommy Meyer:\nYeah, no, this sounds great. I have no questions. \nBryce Young:\nGreat. \nRetsy Holliday:\nI mean, Bryce, at this point, kind of what next steps look like? Are we build out a quote for you. Like this could sound great on paper, and from a numbers perspective, it could not work for your team. And so we're always very transparent. Like, before we get ahead of ourselves here, let's look at the numbers and make sure that financially this fits with what you guys are looking for. If it's for one employee, that's incredibly simple. I can whip up a quote very quickly. And so I will send over a census template of the information that we need in that quote. For that quote. And then again, with one employee, I can turn that around, likely same day. If not, you know, the next day. So that is the kind of next steps here is that we just build out the quote. We review the numbers together. And then, like I said, I think for a January 1st, with one employee, again, we don't have to have like a week-long open enrollment period. She can have a couple of days, but we are targeting December 22nd. To be our last kind of open enrollment day here so that we can make sure that we go get her set up with the carriers. Um, and so just keep that in mind as well. Um, that the, you know, timeline here. We would hopefully be able to regroup like tomorrow to review the numbers together and then make a decision fairly quickly. \nBryce Young:\nOkay, yeah, that'd be great, let's for sure. Um, look at the the one for now and then, yeah, I would like to talk more long term. Because just the way that you scale, seems like it'll add so much more value for what we're offering. And also we'll be able to even potentially save money in the long run. So. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYeah, absolutely. And we're seeing, you know, a lot of cost savings across the board, at least cost containment, right? Like with the individual marketplace, you might be on one plan and the plan goes up by 26%. But typically, when you have 15 or 20 different plan options to choose from, you can personally move off that plan and pick a different plan. So you get out of kind of that year over year, like. 20% renewal hikes. So we can definitely talk about what that would look like for your team. The one thing to keep in mind for the broader team, the one thing to keep in mind with an Icra is that you can actually start one on the first of the month, every single month of the year, but there is a universal January 1st renewal. And so if we were to move forward and like, get your whole team on board. For February 1st or March 1st, they would renew then, and then they would renew again on January 1st, and then they would be on, like the Jan. 1 renewal cycle. Gotcha. \nBryce Young:\nOkay. That all makes sense. All right. We'll look out for the quote and we'll talk internally and go from there. Thank you. Great. \nRetsy Holliday:\nThanks, guys. Appreciate the time today. Thank you. Have a great day. Bye. \n",

ICHRA Education & Product Overview\n- Maggie's Initial Position: Historically viewed ICHRA as something clients handle independently; unclear on broker's role in ICHRA arrangements\n- Thatch's Value Proposition:\n  - Tech-forward platform (founded 3-4 years ago) improving traditional ICHRA experience\n  - 80-90% of business through broker partnerships\n  - Off-marketplace plans offered directly through carriers\n  - Full end-to-end solution (not pieced together with external partners)\n  - Fintech foundation (team from Stripe, Ramp, Rex) ensuring reliable billing\n  - Zero payment delinquencies in 4 years of operation\n\n2. Pricing Structure & Fees\n- Under 50 Employees: $45 per enrolled employee per month (PEPM)\n  - Standard broker commission: $30 PEPM\n  - Thatch retention: $15 PEPM\n  - Broker can adjust their fee with approval\n- One-time Compliance Fee: $50 flat rate\n- COBRA Administration: 2% of premium\n- No implementation fees\n- Competitive positioning: Market range $20-$100 PEPM (competitors often have reimbursement models or inferior platforms)\n\n3. Plan Structure & Compliance\n- Subsidy Eligibility: Employees do NOT qualify for ACA subsidies if employer allowance is affordable (≤9.96% of household income for low-level silver plan)\n- Group Size Rules: Groups over 50 employees don't qualify for marketplace subsidies regardless\n- Plan Access: Off-exchange plans through direct carrier relationships (similar pricing to on-exchange, occasionally better)\n- Ancillary Benefits: Dental/vision typically remain on group platform (more competitive rates); Thatch focuses on medical only\n- COBRA Requirements: Must be offered for continuation of HRA benefits if unused allowance remains\n\n4. Implementation & Technology\n- Setup Timeline: \n  - Best case: Same day (15 minutes to set up account)\n  - Standard: 2-week enrollment window recommended\n  - Fastest observed: 1-week turnaround possible\n  - Banking verification: 1-3 business days (can be instantaneous)\n- Payroll Integration: Connects with all major providers (ADP, Paychex, Paylocity, etc.)\n- Employee Experience:\n  - Mobile-optimized platform\n  - Plan filtering by doctor networks and prescriptions\n  - Same-day licensed advisor support\n  - On-site enrollment support available for larger groups (50+ enrollments)\n- Administrative Features:\n  - COBRA administration\n  - 1095 filings\n  - Transparent cost display including all fees\n  - Age-banded allowance options\n\n5. Market Trends & Future Outlook\n- 2024 Market Conditions: 23-24% average increase in individual plans (vs. historical 6% annual increases)\n- Carrier Support: All major carriers expanding individual marketplace presence, viewing ICHRA positively\n- Legislative Developments: Potential \"Choice Act\" rebranding in January 2025 with possible $100 PEPM incentive for small businesses in first year\n- Industry Adoption: Growing word-of-mouth referrals; early adopters becoming advocates\n\n6. Broker Challenges Identified\n- Education Barrier: Employer groups intimidated by paradigm shift; limited benefits knowledge makes new concepts difficult\n- Maggie's Experience: Previous ICHRA conversations with clients resulted in overwhelm and abandonment\n- Platform Usability Concerns: Recent negative experience with Employee Navigator (vs. Ease) makes simplicity critical\n- Adoption Strategy: Need for gradual education, \"spoon-feeding\" information over time\n\nCRITICAL MOMENTS & TIMESTAMPS\n\nEarly Conversation (Minutes 1-5):\n- Maggie admits limited ICHRA knowledge; historically positioned it as \"do it yourself\" option\n- Confusion about broker's role in ICHRA arrangements\n\nMid-Conversation (Minutes 10-15):\n- Detailed pricing discussion; Maggie confirms focus on 2-50 employee groups\n- COBRA clarification needed (Maggie unfamiliar with COBRA on individual plans)\n- Subsidy eligibility questions resolved\n\nLate Conversation (Minutes 20-25):\n- Maggie acknowledges education as primary obstacle with employer clients\n- Requests demo video to evaluate platform simplicity\n- Discusses need for \"HSA champion\" approach - one early adopter to drive adoption\n\nClosing (Minutes 25-30):\n- Agreement to gradual education approach with future clients\n- Maggie acknowledges need to \"spoon-feed\" concept to employers over time\n\nNEXT STEPS & ACTION ITEMS\n\nImmediate Actions (By End of Week - December 20, 2025):\nResponsible Party: Seth Wood\n- [ ] Send onboarding videos demonstrating platform walkthrough\n- [ ] Provide one-pagers and educational resources\n- [ ] Share demo showing employee user experience and simplicity\n\nShort-Term (Q1 2026):\nResponsible Party: Maggie Hammarstrom\n- [ ] Review educational materials and platform demo\n- [ ] Identify potential client groups for mid-year ICHRA education conversations\n- [ ] Consider \"seed planting\" approach with select clients (no pressure, future-year consideration)\n\nResponsible Party: Tyler Ackerman (Thatch)\n- [ ] Follow up with Maggie in early 2026\n- [ ] Remain available for census submissions and quote requests\n\nOngoing Partnership Development:\nResponsible Party: Both Parties\n- [ ] Maggie to submit census for any interested groups to Tyler Ackerman\n- [ ] Initial quote review meeting with Seth before client presentation\n- [ ] Joint client presentations/demos when appropriate\n- [ ] Potential on-site enrollment support for larger groups (if applicable)\n\nFuture Considerations (2026 Planning):\n- Monitor January 2025 legislative developments regarding \"Choice Act\" and small business incentives\n- Evaluate ICHRA as alternative for groups facing significant renewals\n- Position as choice-based solution rather than \"last resort\"\n- Build internal broker team knowledge on ICHRA fundamentals\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES\n\nMaggie's Current ICHRA Experience: Only 2 groups currently using HRAs; not her primary expertise area\n\nRelationship Status: Positive educational conversation; Maggie receptive but cautious due to past client resistance\n\nKey Success Factor: Platform simplicity and ease of use will be critical for Maggie's confidence in recommending to clients\n\nCompetitive Advantage: Thatch's technology focus and broker-friendly approach differentiate from traditional ICHRA administrators\n\nCultural Note: Maggie values straightforward communication and appreciates Seth's patience with rescheduling\n\nFOLLOW-UP PRIORITY: Medium-High\nMaggie is an active broker with relevant book of business (2-50 groups) but needs education and confidence-building before bringing ICHRA to clients. Relationship development and resource provision are key to future partnership success."

            "transcript": "Seth Wood:\nHey, Maggie. Good morning. Good. Q4. How are you doing? \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nOh, my gosh. It's still Q4. Yeah. \nSeth Wood:\nThere we go. \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nIt's still Q4. And yeah, who planned a meeting in December? I guess it was me. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, no worries. I mean, we could have always bumped it to next year. It's no big deal. \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nYeah. No, that's fine. \nSeth Wood:\nWe're just, yeah, we're kind of, you know, things are the the one one gap's getting closer, so things are a little calm. But it's going to pick up in a week or two for next, for two ones. And then, yeah, yeah, it's great to meet you either way, and super happy to be helpful. I know, I think I think I will look back through our notes. It was, I was, I think you had questions. Wanted to learn more about Thatch from what I understand? But I just want to be helpful, like, and walk you through more about the platform, us, whatever's just best for you, you know, and what we can do. Yeah. \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nSo, I mean, I guess let's start from Square one. I've got, you know, a good understanding, I guess, of what an icra is and how it works. But tell me how, what you guys do, how you work. \nSeth Wood:\nWhat's the differentiator, for sure? Yeah. Great question. So. \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nWell, and I'll start by telling you, I've always looked at Icra as to a client. If you want to do that, you're going to go off and do that on your own. And so this whole concept of, well, we're going to work. With the TPA, somehow make that, you know, worth our while. Um, that kind of. For me, that's where the breakdown is. Like, I don't understand why we're taking people off of a group health plan that's somehow still staying involved in that process. So, um, yeah, in the process of quoting, like, yeah, you just tell me what you do. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, no, so I think, Icra, let's just back high level 2018, it was started. I think it's has been a traditionally a traditional place where brokers, last resort people go here just because they got to go here. Not great experientially, but the cost savings is decent, is good. Like, that's what the client needs. Have it. We have been around for three or four years as a company. We were a tech forward brand overall. So I think the technology has been catching up and merging and making it a much better situation for. A, the employer experience, employee experience. Also, a lot of the way we built the business is direct partnerships with so many brokers and partners, period. So 80 or 90% of my business is through you and through other people. And so we have people that come in off the street, word of mouth, organically and reach out to us. But we're always asking about the brokers. How are you working? Please, let's connect. Let's talk. We want to make it a good fit for everybody. So that's why we're very transparent with, you know, how we do our pricing, everything else like that. We want to include the broker fees, everything like that. So what we do, if you're looking, so like how I partner best with my team, my partners with this, like, you know, coming to Thatch, like means right now, like the employee goes through thatch and gets to choose the plans. So they're not going out on the marketplace. They're going through Thatch. All the plans that we do today are off marketplace plans. So they're basically brought through the carrier directly. So we can... Be, uh. We can facilitate a much better experience for them. They're choosing a plan to carry the employers paying directly to the carrier for the employee. \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nOkay, so let me ask you a question. They if they have an Icra, do they not qualify for a subsidy? And I mean, this is all, of course, not withstanding the shenanigans that are happening January. \nSeth Wood:\nFirst, if the allowance is affordable, if they're giving them enough money for the ACA compliance piece, like no. More than 9.96% of their household income to purchase low-level silver. If they're giving them enough, then they wouldn't get a subsidy. Because it's a qualified health offering, basically, by the IRS and by everyone's standard. \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nSo obviously that's going to vary by employee based on their income. \nSeth Wood:\nAnd if they're over 50 in group size, if they're a larger group, they would not qualify either way for the marketplace. Okay. If they're under 50, they can. But they wouldn't necessarily get a subsidy if their employer's offering them enough. Basically because the because the AC is just pushing people to go to the the employer for insurance, basically. Okay, okay, Yeah, good question. So the whole, the whole win for that and I'll walk you through, kind of like what it looks like for you with any groups like, but we want to enroll them through that, we want to make that experience better. It's not a good experience to go out on the marketplace and get a reimburse that is less than ideal. And they can do that with this model if they really want a plan that doesn't exist on that for some reason. If they did want to do, we can do that, but we don't. We pursue them to go through that because we do a better curation experience, like choosing a plan is, it's really nice product. It's a really easy situation. They can also jump on a call, you know, and you could be involved in that, but there's a lot of employees enrolling. So we do have licensed advisors same day that can jump and ask questions about prescriptions. They can also filter the plans through the product by doctors right away. They can see which would fit their doctor needs. And then, if there are issues and questions, our team can walk them through that too, directly through the carrier. For, like, backdating issues, anything like that you'd expect. Um, we also, for a larger group size, and I mean, like, you know, 100 employee enrollments, bigger, we have thousands of employees that are enrolled in Thatch, like big companies, too. So like, if they do, we do on sites, we do coordinate. I worked with not even a thousand group, I had a group who had 50 or 60 enrolled, potential enrolled, a broker in Florida, We coordinated and they went on site to do that support piece just to help be the present person. And if we have enough strategic partnership, where we need to be involved. Thatch can jump in and fly in and help. \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nAlmost all of my groups are two to 50, so I'm not we. I will be dealing with space. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, yeah, no, but we can make sure it's easy and understandable and helpful, and so we don't get us like us taking over and doing. I guess that the way it works with us is like you're still involved, we still think you're valid. And we don't do all the benefits too, so we just do the medical, really. Um, dental vision would usually be on group with our broker partners. We can do it here, but the rates are just way more competitive. \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nSo with an ICRA, are they still allowed to offer dental vision on a group platform or does that? OK, I thought, for some reason, you thought they could not have any. \nSeth Wood:\nWe do that here. \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nBenefits. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, we do that for medical only at Thatch, internally. We do our group group dental vision externally. \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nSo, OK, in the two to 50 space for. It's always been my experience that individual plans on and off the exchange. It's the same plans that are offered. At the same rates. Is that not true with if it goes through that, or are you adding no more? How do you? \nSeth Wood:\nHow do you get paid admin admin fee so which includes your fees? So like we don't charge any difference, we don't mark up our costs. The off exchange, on exchange are very similar. Uh, there might be a few dollars different. Sometimes. Sometimes I've seen some plans or I don't know, I can't speak to all, but some plans are cheaper on off exchange. It's just the carrier's offering directly. I don't know why, some, some, I had one the other day that an employee, my coworker showed me, and it was really dramatically different, but that's rare. I think majority is going to be pretty neck and neck with what you'd expect to see. Um, so I'm sorry, what was your, my, my question, my brain is. So that was my question. \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nI thought, I mean, I, so we actually sold individual plans for a while at like when the ACA first rolled around, um, And at that time, if you bought a plant on the exchange, the price was exactly the same as if you bought it off the exchange. The only advantage of going through the exchange was if you qualify for a premium subsidy. But it's such a nightmare that I always told people, look, if you're not qualifying for a subsidy, buy it through an individual broker. \nSeth Wood:\nTotally. Yeah. Yeah. I think, I think, I mean, the exchange they built, it's better than it was when it started. Remember that launch? Terrible. Yeah. I mean, it's definitely better now, but we just. Again, it's all about the employee experience, all the employer experience too. So like, you know, like administratively we do Cobra, we administer that if we needed. It's different on the individual plans, but we still do it because we're required to. That's easy, um, 1095 filings. \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nWhy would there be Cobra on individual plans? \nSeth Wood:\nGreat question, because a there is, but b because they are Hras, it's an HRA. If there are leftover dollars, potentially, and they enabled that, they could use those leftover dollars to pay the premiums. After they left. If they had something left over in their Thatch account. And so you have to have an administrator for that specifically, uniquely. But most of the time, what I tell my customers is, if they leave, you'll file the notice. The employee should really just go and they'll keep the plan, or just go on the exchange and get a plan on the exchange at that point. Because there's no reason to pay for administration fees on an individual plan. \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nYeah. So I'm still confused on Cobra on an individual plan. So my understanding was. An icra is a health reimbursement arrangement. If I am employed by a company, it's just a funding mechanism for my employer to reimburse me for a portion. What is that? Go away. For my employer to reimburse me for a portion of my premiums on an individual plan. I can go into, and this is, that's notwithstanding. I can go into the exchange or I can go to an individual broker, buy myself a plan, an individual plan. And my company will reimburse me for a portion of that plan. So if the company says, okay, we're going to give everybody 300 bucks a month. You're saying, if my plan only costs 200 bucks a month, I have money left over, theoretically. So how does, I don't understand how that works. Like, what is in, in what, if I have. \nSeth Wood:\nIf you have a hundred dollars surplus left. If you leave a company and you have $100 in a HRA, that money is your money. And you technically could use that money to pay the next month's premium towards your next month's premium. \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nSo it would just be for that month. I'm not accumulating $100 per month. Yeah, it might be. \nSeth Wood:\nAnd it could be way more than 100. It's up to the employer. But that's where the administration cobra matters still, because, like, that's money that you would want to utilize. Most majority, I'd say 90% of the time. An employee is just best to just keep the plan and pay it, keep paying it, not going through the administration. Unless they really do have that, because who should pay a 2% fee if there's no leftover dollars? There's no reason to pay. But it's something we have to legally offer either way. \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nSo then back to COBRA, my understanding was Cobra was you get to continue on a group plan. Right. \nSeth Wood:\nIt's the same thing for individual. Same thing here. It's a continuation of. Your hra benefit, basically. I'll see if I can send you a link on that. \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nYeah, I guess I need to bone up on that. Because I have, like, I like, two groups that have HRAs. So it's not my wheelhouse pick. Okay. \nSeth Wood:\nNo, no, it's okay. And it's just different. It's not as necessary. But in that scenario, it would be helpful if they did have money they want us to administer so they can utilize. That makes sense to me. Outside of that, it's just a compliance piece we follow. So when they off board an employee on that, they click their name. They can click offward Employee. They'll get a prompt from us to send the Cobra notice and to stop the payments for future premiums from the employer, basically. \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nSo then let's talk about fees. So your admin fee is 2% of the premium? \nSeth Wood:\nFor COBRA. That's for COBRA. \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nFor COBRA. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, yeah. For Thatch, for under 50, under 50 groups, $45 per employee that enrolls per month. Okay. $30 is the standard fee to you. Out of that. That's the standard partner fee, broker fee. You can, whatever you got, you want to do internally is up to you. If you said, Seth, we can adjust. I got approval. We can go down, we can go up. You just let us know. \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nSo basically, you're taking 15 of that. \nSeth Wood:\n15. Correct. \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nSo I can technically charge my, my groups $15 ppm and take nothing. \nSeth Wood:\nIf you want to do that apps, just let us know before the conversation starts. So we can make sure that for the client, so they don't see, but yeah, whatever you decide. There is one more fee, but it's just a $50 flat rate once you're in the business. That's just a compliance fee. You only work, you said, with groups 2 to 50 size, usually. Is that right? \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nYeah. \nSeth Wood:\nOkay, perfect. So, yeah, anything over 50, it does change a little bit for ACA because we're doing filings, but that's pretty standard, the 45 BEPM. Okay. But, yeah, just let us know. And that's per enrolled. Enrolled employee. So, you know, 20 employees enroll. When we do our quoting, we have a dynamic tool so we can do age banding and things that they want to see. We can make it very, very fair if they have employees that are older, younger, so they can both buy the same plan. With getting a little bit more money for older employees versus younger, we can do that. We always show the full costs on our screen, including that. We're very transparent so they can see exactly what they're going to be paying in total. But that's the only fees they would have from us. No implementation. \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nIt's not really fair to ask you what your competitors charge, but is that a competitive rate? I have no idea. And I'll be honest, I don't like talking to 10 different vendors. I'd rather just have one. \nSeth Wood:\nNo, it's totally fair. I mean, so we competitors will charge anywhere between 20 pepum to 100 pepum. I've heard a wheelhouse. The reason we charge what we charge as a company is because of our product. It's a full end to end solution. So we're not going externally with other partners to piece things together. Some, like a competitor who might be 20, pep them, the one or two I'm thinking of, I know that they don't do as sophisticated, sort of like platform for the employees. Some of them have to do a reimbursement model with that 20 pep them. It's not a great fit. And some of them have lackluster billing situations and issues. So we're a fintech company at our heart. A lot of us come from Stripe, Ramp, Rex. Because why? An HRA is a fintech product. So we built this out on the back end, with our healthcare team, half of our company. I mean, our head of growth is from the CEO of United Healthcare Pacific Northwest. He ran that for many years. We have a whole frontier in front of us of that. I think. What that means is like, we haven't had a delinquency in payments in four years at all, ever. So we've paid on time. Billing's been paid. We've built the billing systems that you use at the checkout counters. So if you do this right, it should be extremely smooth and easy. And that's kind of where the costs come from, really. And it takes that administrative headache away, usually, for managing this. \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nWhat's your implementation lead time? \nSeth Wood:\nSo super fast. I'm not just, that's not just like a, it's really, so you, They have to set up a Thatch admin account. And that just means they connect into their payroll. Whoever they use, we integrate whoever they can imagine. ADP paychecks to any number of things. Paylocity. Whoever they're working with, we will integrate. Banking verification can take one to three business days, depending upon a manual verification, if needed. Best case scenario, it's instantaneous, same day. So it could take 15 minutes to set up a Thatch account. Syncs over the roster, and then they can send the invites in an ideal state. It could be done same day, ideally. It could be. But realistically, they need to determine an allowance. They need to decide where they're contributing. That's the hardest part of this. And then they want to give their team enough time to select a health care plan. So we do a two-week standard. They can go one week. They can go a month. They can do whatever they want. But two weeks is a pretty good amount of time for an open enrollment window. And then, if they want, any webinars. So we can help communication. We can help, you know, I've jumped in and had some, you know, group. Sessions we've done, which is always fun to meet the employees and stuff like that. We can definitely handle that. But, you know, we have people this week looking for a one, one. still, we're talking to get them set up and going and it's going to be doable. And so that's, that's something we can, we can roll with if we need to, to help. \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nOkay. Hey, is Jeremy still there? Yeah. Yeah. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah. He's our head of our broker channel partners. Gotcha. \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nYeah. \nSeth Wood:\nOh, awesome. Jeremy is fantastic. Like, I know he has been like. Amazing, like he works every day and he's been on site for our employees, running around, helping them get enrolled. Like, he's a legend. Love that guy. \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nOh great, He's great, He's great, He's a great, He's got my back. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, so well, for sure. Have you met Tyler? by the way? He's our, uh, yeah, Tyler's your, um. So, anytime if you felt like you wanted to look into this with a group for yourself, like, Uh, you, you can submit. Tyler Ackerman. And he may be on the previous thread that we had, but yeah, that rings a bell. Here's your point of contact for any group, so we can track for you in case they didn't or things like that. But you could just submit a census. Um, we can always, you know, run the numbers with you. First time around, I'll probably just want to meet just to show you what the cost. Does it seem competitive? does it look like a fit? Um, and then, if it does seem interesting, we'd always can jump on a call with you. And, like, walk them through some slides, a demo, just to make sure it looks. It's like it's something worth their while, but, you know, just, just always keep us in the loop. We're always here to support. And it's, I would say, the ICHRA is changing quickly. There's probably, they're going to be debating in January to rebrand it as the Choice act. It's coming back around on the floor with this debate. To add some incentives for small businesses next year for the ICHRA for small size, potentially a hundred dollars per employee per month for the first year. \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nSo what's, you know, what's your messaging, I guess, on what's happening in the individual marketplace? Because, you know, rates are going up, subsidies are, it still looks like they're going away, which is going to hurt a lot of people. How, you know, how are people reacting to that? What are you guys telling them? \nSeth Wood:\nWell, I'll tell you, we have seen, even with the headwinds, I think, what we saw this year was the worst year in healthcare history, right? So, like, it's terrible. Group and individual had an increase, no matter what. So. That didn't stop the level of interest. Because if it's super bad in the group, people also want to explore what's going on in the individual marketplace, too. I think year over year, the costs still shake out cheaper. We had a 23%, 24% nationwide average increase in individual plans this year. Prior years, every year has been 6% only. So it's been much more stabilized. The future is extremely still optimistic. I mean, I can't tell you how many internal carriers have come to us. We have talked with all the blues. Every carrier is stoked about ICHRA. They're stoked about individual marketplace. They're expanding more and more in there. It's not like it's a competitor, like they're slowing down. They think that it can actually add more value for their growth in the future. So. I think the next year is going to be very interesting, especially if policy additions happen to this. And I don't think the Icra is going to be just a last resort, as much as it has been in the past. I think we're seeing more people still exploring it as an alternative. Maybe it's not the first choice, but it's also an alternative that is viable, right? And that's where our partnership can fit in well. If it makes sense, we are always happy to help with the group. If it doesn't, of course, that's fine, too. But it's a rapidly evolving industry. And this is definitely something that every partner we know is looking at as well, just to see. So I'll send you some resources. Just feel free to look at some, I got some onboarding videos you can look through and see how it looks. \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nBut yeah, product's great. \nSeth Wood:\nIt works really well. And I love our support team, just know why. They're fantastic people. So I've watched them hustle through the heat of Q4 and they are answering questions, figuring things out. So, yeah, we're a good place to be. It's, you know, for on my end, it's, it's. \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nIt's about. The big obstacle is is educating employer groups. Right. It's they don't, because, you know, they're, it's outside of their comfort zone, and it's learning something brand new. And they they know so little about benefits to begin with that. You know, it's so intimidating that they the idea of coming to them and going, OK, This is a complete paradigm shift. Here's a whole brand new thing that you need to learn. I will walk you through it. But even then. People just throw up their hands and walk away. You know, we've, I've had the IPER conversation with a few groups over the last few years, And it's just been too much for them to wrap their brains around. \nSeth Wood:\nLoop this in. And if you even just want to have, like a mid-year, Hey, I want to share this idea with you. Not no pressure, just, just to plant the seed for future years. I think that's always a good starting point because I totally agree. Education is key. And then, but we're seeing more organic. well, my friend's company worked with you and had a good experience. They told me this could be good. We just want to learn more. Like, there's that's word of mouth. I think it's helping with that right now. Cause some people are, that's the, the early adopters are, are really the most active cult members, right. In any form of education. And they're going, this wasn't too bad. You should share. \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nIt's like, HSA, right? You always have, I, whenever, whenever you guys in HSA plan, I say, you're going to have one person enrolled. They're like, well, we only had one person enrolled. No, know, that person's your HSA champion and there it's going to grow. And yeah, it's, it's, yeah, you've always got to have at least one person banging the drum. \nSeth Wood:\nAnd it took 10 years, once the HSAS were released, for it to really start to gain traction nationally. And so we're still at seven or eight years in with the era. And I think we're getting more and more interest now. It just takes healthcare moves at a snail's pace for some of us, you know that. So it's taking time, but it is a great alternative. Nothing to be, not for you, but like nothing to be afraid of. It's more about how it's done, how it's handled. And if you use the technology and a good third party administrator like us, or someone else who knows what they're doing, it can be a really good fit for certain groups, especially if they're getting hit hard with renewals or they're getting risked out of pools because of sick people and things like that. So that can be very beneficial or choice. Sorry, go ahead. \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nDefinitely send me if you've got like a video that sort of walks you through the site, like as a demo, that would be helpful because. You know, simplicity of use is a big, a big deal. Like, we moved, you know, we just moved everybody from ease to employee navigator, and employee navigator is no ease. Like, you know, we were promised it would be simple to use. Well, it's not that simple. So people who are, who don't, you know, grasp the technology in the first place are having a hard time with navigator. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah. \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nThat for, you know, if I can say with confidence, the Thatch platform is easy to use, that will make all the difference. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, it's. I mean, I'm not just I'm picky. It's easy because I come from Stripe and I come from like tech companies, like, it's very easy. It's mobile optimized, like it's a. But I'll show you the walkthrough. It's really straightforward. I think there always will be questions. So we just got to handle that. Well, like, how do I get my prescriptions? How do I know if this is the right plan for me? Things sometimes pop up. So how do you deal with? That? is very important, too. But yeah, anything, I'll send you, all of our one pagers, everything we got. And then just keep us in the loop next year. If you have any clients, you think this could be a fit, We can always jump and help work with you on that station and explore that option for them. But yeah, I appreciate your, your two, four time. So. Yeah, no, no, no. \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nI thank you for your time as well. And, and for your patience, I know I sort of blew things off a couple of times, but. No, no, it's good. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah. \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nI think it's just, if we're, if it's going to work for us, we just need to like, sort of spoon. Feed it to people over and over and over again, until they kind of get it. And then we'll go from there. \nSeth Wood:\nFor sure. And I expect we'll be working more on sites next year with MMA and a lot of other partners. Just to be in-house, so we can meet and to educate and talk and show things. So I expect more of that on our end. We've been doing a lot of education globally with our partnership teams. So you'll probably hear from Tyler at some point in the future, either way. But great to meet you and have a great little holiday. And if you can, in the middle of it all, but thank you. \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nNo, we're, I'm planning on it. Yeah. \nSeth Wood:\nGood. Good. That's right. \nMaggie Hammarstrom:\nAll right. Have a good one. Thank you so much for your time. \nSeth Wood:\nYou too. Pleasure. Right. Bye. \n",

                "value": "Account Notes: Roof Consulting Services, Inc. - Thatch ICHRA Discovery Call\n\nDate of Conversation: Tuesday, December 16, 2025\n\nCOMPANY OVERVIEW\n- Company Name: Roof Consulting Services, Inc.\n- Location: Richmond, Virginia (with some employees in other states)\n- Company Structure: S-Corporation\n- Total Employees: 34\n- Current Health Plan Enrollment: 18 employees\n- Current Renewal Date: March 1, 2026\n- Current Contribution Strategy: $300 flat allowance (meets ACA minimum affordability requirement)\n\nKEY DISCUSSION POINTS\n\nPrimary Motivation for ICHRA Exploration\n1. Cost Management Concerns:\n   - Historical rate increases: 15-20% annually\n   - Expected 2026 renewal increase: 10-15% (per current broker Sheldon)\n   - Industry trend: Other companies experiencing 20-30% increases for 2026\n   - William Sanders' wife's company successfully implemented similar ICHRA model to avoid rate increases\n\n2. Desired Outcomes:\n   - Avoid constant premium increases for employees\n   - Provide flexibility for employees to use health spending in alternative ways\n   - Reduce administrative burden\n   - Give employees more plan choice\n\nCurrent Insurance Situation\n- Current Carriers: Anthem (medical), switched from Anthem to Sentara previously for better rates\n- Dental/Vision: Separate group plan with stable pricing (no increases in recent years)\n- Rating Structure: ACA-rated, age-banded with composite rates\n- Broker Flexibility: Limited negotiation power due to small group size\n\nICHRA Model Discussion\n\nAdvantages Presented:\n- Individual marketplace rates historically increase ~6-8% annually (vs. 25-35% group average)\n- 2026 individual market rates already set and locked for full 12 months\n- Employees can choose from 65+ plan options in Virginia (Anthem, United, Oscar, Cigna)\n- Plans range from $397 (Bronze) to $527+ (Gold) for age 45 in ZIP 23060\n- No underwriting based on health status - only age and location\n- Protection from risk pool issues (one sick employee doesn't impact entire group)\n- Leftover allowance dollars can be used for qualified medical expenses pre-tax\n- Plans are portable - employees keep coverage if they leave company\n- Special enrollment period triggered by switching to ICHRA\n\nAdministrative Features:\n- Thatch handles enrollment, carrier coordination, COBRA administration, 1095 forms\n- Integration with current CPA payroll process via CSV deduction report\n- Mobile-optimized enrollment platform\n- Same-day licensed advisor support available\n- Direct carrier payment (not reimbursement model)\n- 85% of employees complete enrollment without assistance\n\nPricing Structure:\n- $45 per enrolled employee per month (PEPM)\n- $50 flat monthly fee to company\n- No implementation fees\n- All compliance and administrative services included\n\nCRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED: S-CORP OWNERSHIP RESTRICTION\n\nThe Problem\n- IRS Regulation: Owners of >2% of S-Corp cannot participate in ICHRA due to pre-tax benefit rules\n- Impact on This Company: 5 out of 18 enrolled employees are part-owners\n- Reason: IRS considers it \"double-dipping\" since S-Corp owners already receive tax advantages and can write off healthcare costs\n\nImplications\n- Owners would need to purchase individual marketplace plans post-tax (not through Thatch ICRA)\n- Owners would not receive the $300 (or any) pre-tax allowance through ICHRA\n- Thatch could assist with plan selection, but not facilitate pre-tax payment\n- Alternative mentioned: Owners could potentially get separate small group plan (compliance to be verified)\n- William Sanders indicated this is \"prohibitive\" to moving forward\n\nSTAKEHOLDER IDENTIFICATION\n\nProspect Company Representatives\n\nWilliam Sanders\n- Role: Part-owner (>2% S-Corp ownership)\n- Responsibilities: Primary decision-maker, initiated contact with Thatch\n- Engagement Level: High - drove the meeting, asked detailed questions\n- Key Concern: S-Corp ownership restriction affecting 5 of 18 enrolled employees\n\nKim West\n- Role: Part-owner (>2% S-Corp ownership), appears to handle HR/benefits administration\n- Responsibilities: Benefits management, employee communication\n- Engagement Level: Active participant, asked clarifying questions about enrollment, Medicare, dental/vision\n- Context: Has personal experience with Medicare (spouse Dennis on Medicare Advantage with $0 premium)\n\nCurrent Broker\n\nSheldon\n- Role: Current insurance broker for Roof Consulting Services\n- Responsibilities: Manages current group plan, provides rate quotes, plan selection\n- Engagement Level: Collaborative, asked technical questions to understand ICHRA model\n- Attitude: Professional, stated \"I want what's best for them\" and willing to support ICHRA if it's the better option\n- Expertise: Handles both small group and large group clients, familiar with ACA rating, has Medicare knowledge\n- Key Contributions:\n  - Confirmed expected 10-15% renewal increase\n  - Asked about subsidy eligibility and on-exchange plans\n  - Clarified Medicare Part B reimbursement questions\n  - Discussed rate increase timing for individual plans\n\nThatch Representative\n\nSeth Wood\n- Role: Sales representative for Thatch\n- Responsibilities: Product education, cost analysis, enrollment support\n- Location: Middle Tennessee\n- Approach: Educational, transparent about limitations (S-Corp issue), no pressure\n\nIMPORTANT MILESTONES & TIMESTAMPS\n\nHistorical Context\n- Past Practice: Company switched from Anthem to Sentara previously for better rates\n- Dental/Vision Stability: No rate increases in recent years on separate group plan\n- Consistent Increases: 15-20% annual medical premium increases historically\n\nCurrent Timeline\n- December 16, 2025: Discovery call held\n- March 1, 2026: Current group plan renewal date\n- Late October 2025: 2026 individual marketplace rates finalized (already completed)\n- January 1, 2027: Next potential rate increase point if ICHRA implemented in 2026\n\nCritical Decision Points in Conversation\n\nMinute 8-10: William explained motivation based on wife's company experience with 20-30% increases and successful ICHRA implementation\n\nMinute 15-18: Sheldon provided context on expected 10-15% renewal increase and explained ACA rating limitations\n\nMinute 25-28: Seth demonstrated Virginia marketplace options (65 plans, $397-$527+ range for age 45)\n\nMinute 35-38: CRITICAL TURNING POINT - Seth disclosed S-Corp ownership restriction\n- William's immediate response: \"That would be kind of prohibitive to us\"\n- Reason: 5 of 18 enrolled employees are part-owners\n\nMinute 42-45: Discussion of workarounds and implications for owners (post-tax purchase, no allowance)\n\nMinute 48-50: Sheldon asked technical questions about subsidies, rate increase timing, Medicare reimbursement\n\nMinute 52-54: William confirmed S-Corp issue is likely prohibitive but willing to review numbers\n\nNEXT STEPS & ACTION ITEMS\n\nImmediate Actions (No Specific Deadline Assigned)\n\nProspect's Responsibilities:\n1. Internal Discussion - William, Kim, and ownership team to discuss S-Corp ownership impact\n   - Responsible: William Sanders, Kim West, other part-owners\n   - Decision Point: Whether 5 owners being excluded is acceptable given potential employee benefits\n\n2. Consult with CPA - Verify tax implications and explore potential workarounds for S-Corp owners\n   - Responsible: Company CPA\n   - Questions to address: Can owners get separate group plan? Any other compliant structures?\n\n3. Gather Renewal Information - Collect 2026 renewal rates from Sheldon when available\n   - Responsible: Sheldon (broker)\n   - Timing: Before March 1, 2026 renewal\n   - Purpose: Enable apples-to-apples cost comparison\n\n4. Collect Census Data - If proceeding, provide employee census for cost analysis\n   - Responsible: Kim West\n   - Information needed: Ages, locations, dependent information for all 18 enrolled employees\n\nThatch's Responsibilities:\n\n1. Send Follow-up Resources - Seth to email:\n   - Plan comparison tool link (Virginia marketplace options)\n   - Employee onboarding experience walkthrough video\n   - Additional educational materials\n   - Responsible: Seth Wood\n   - Status: Committed during call\n\n2. Clarify Medicare Part B Reimbursement - Confirm whether Part B premiums ($185/month base) are reimbursable through ICHRA\n   - Responsible: Seth Wood\n   - Status: To follow up via email\n\n3. Cost Analysis (If Requested) - Run detailed cost comparison showing:\n   - Individual plan costs for each employee by age\n   - Flat rate vs. age-banded allowance options\n   - Total cost including Thatch fees ($45 PEPM + $50/month)\n   - Comparison to 2026 group renewal rates\n   - Responsible: Seth Wood\n   - Timing: After census data received and renewal rates available\n\nSheldon's Responsibilities:\n\n1. Provide 2026 Renewal Rates - Deliver group plan renewal quotes for March 1, 2026\n   - Responsible: Sheldon\n   - Timing: Standard renewal timeline (typically 60-90 days before renewal)\n\n2. Support Decision Process - Provide objective comparison between group and ICHRA options\n   - Responsible: Sheldon\n   - Approach: \"I want what's best for them\" - will recommend ICHRA if it's superior option\n\n3. Assist Owners if ICHRA Proceeds - Help 5 part-owners select individual marketplace plans (post-tax)\n   - Responsible: Sheldon (or Thatch team)\n   - Timing: Only if company decides to proceed despite S-Corp restriction\n\nDEAL STATUS & PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nCurrent Status: Discovery/Education Complete - Awaiting Internal Decision\n\nPrimary Obstacle: S-Corp ownership restriction affecting 5 of 18 enrolled employees (28% of covered population)\n\nDecision Framework:\n- Proceed if: Cost savings and employee benefits significantly outweigh negative impact to 5 owners\n- Do Not Proceed if: Owners unwilling to lose pre-tax benefit and pay post-tax for individual plans\n\nLikelihood Assessment:\n- William's statement \"prohibitive to us\" suggests low probability of immediate adoption\n- However, left door open: \"We may still consider it\" if employee benefits are significant\n- Company is being proactive (renewal not until March 1, 2026) which shows serious interest\n- Cost comparison will be determining factor\n\nAlternative Scenarios:\n1. Delay to 2027: Company may revisit after seeing 2026 renewal impact\n2. Partial Implementation: Explore if non-owner employees could use ICHRA while owners stay on group plan (compliance unclear)\n3. Corporate Restructuring: Unlikely, but could explore changing ownership structure (not discussed)\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES\n\nDental/Vision Strategy\n- Current separate group plan is stable and cost-effective\n- Recommendation: Keep dental/vision separate from ICHRA\n- Employees could potentially use leftover ICHRA dollars for dental/vision premiums if applicable\n\nMedicare Considerations\n- At least one employee's spouse (Dennis) currently on Medicare Advantage ($0 premium)\n- Medicare-eligible employees (65+) would need separate Medicare plans\n- Would still receive ICHRA allowance for Medicare premium reimbursement\n- Thatch has team to assist with Medicare enrollment\n\nSubsidy Eligibility\n- Sheldon asked about marketplace subsidies\n- With $300 \"affordable\" allowance, employees unlikely to qualify for subsidies\n- If allowance were lower (unaffordable), employees could opt out and get subsidized marketplace plans independently\n\nRate Increase Timing\n- Individual plans: Annual increases effective January 1\n- If implemented March 1, 2026: No rate increase until January 1, 2027\n- Employees would have partial deductible year one (March-December 2026)\n- Company could offer post-tax bonus to offset partial deductible if desired\n\nCOMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE\n\n- William's wife's company successfully implemented similar ICHRA model\n- That company maintained same insurance plans at individual rates without premium cost impact\n- Indicates there are other ICHRA providers in market (not specified which one)\n- Thatch differentiation: Technology platform, same-day advisor support, full administrative services\n\nFOLLOW-UP TIMELINE RECOMMENDATION\n\n- Week of December 23, 2025: Seth sends promised resources and Medicare clarification\n- Early January 2026: Check in on internal discussions and CPA consultation\n- Mid-January 2026: Sheldon provides 2026 renewal rates\n- Late January 2026: Run cost analysis if company still interested\n- Early February 2026: Final decision needed to implement by March 1, 2026\n- If No for 2026: Stay in touch for potential 2027 consideration after experiencing renewal increase\n\nRISK FACTORS\n\n1. S-Corp Ownership Structure: Primary deal-breaker - 28% of enrolled population excluded\n2. Decision-Maker Impact: Both primary contacts (William and Kim) are affected owners\n3. Timing Pressure: March 1"

How's everyone doing today? Same to you. Yeah. Where are you guys based out of? \nWilliam Sanders:\nRichmond, Virginia. Awesome. \nSeth Wood:\nAwesome. Yeah. I'm over here in Middle Tennessee. So nice to meet everyone. Is there anyone else today joining on the call? Is it a full house here? \nKim West:\nSo we have Sheldon on the call, who is our current insurance broker. OK, cool. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah. \nKim West:\nSo that he can kind of compare and contrast what we've traditionally done with what this looks like. \nSeth Wood:\nOkay, cool. Yeah, I mean, I know it's great to meet everyone. So we'd love to just maybe good starting point today, would just would love to know maybe a little bit about, you know, prompted you to reach out, for sure. And then I can happily walk you through a little more about what we do here and how it works. If there's questions, we can go through the slides, things like that. And then, you know, if there's interest in further investigating this, we can definitely do that. But my goal usually is just to be super educational and helpful, either way. So. We'd love to know, just starting, and I'm glad Sheldon's here. Tell me, Kellen, a little bit, what maybe prompted you to want to look into Thatch, and how did you hear about us? \nWilliam Sanders:\nThe main thing that prompted it, my wife does HR and bookkeeping for another company who's already been through their insurance renewal process for the upcoming year. And they were looking at about a 20 to 30 percent increase in rates. For their group rate. So they actually had, like, a company-wide survey and sort of proposed using a program similar to y'all's. That they were able to basically maintain the same insurance plans, but on an individual rate basis. And it really didn't affect their premium cost at all. Okay. We're basically trying to avoid constant increases in cost to our employees and the option to use their health spending, what we allocate to them, in other avenues, if that's what they desire. \nSeth Wood:\nGot it. This is your current organization that's been dealing with the 20% to 30%? Increase or is this just another separate organization? \nWilliam Sanders:\nYeah, I mean, historically, you know, our organization has seen about a 15 to 20 percent increase on an annual basis. \nSeth Wood:\nOkay. \nWilliam Sanders:\nYou know, my wife's company, they were looking at like a 20 to 30 percent increase this year. And from what I've heard from a couple other business owners, that their increases this year have been more significant than in years prior. Yeah. So that's what we're trying to avoid. \nKim West:\nOur renewal is March 1st, so we're a little bit behind the January 1st. And Sheldon, with your other companies, what kind of rate hikes have you been seeing? \nSheldon:\nWell, my small groups, which you fall under, I'm seeing 10 to 15 percent. On large group, where I'm able to negotiate, I've been able to get them down to 3 to 4 percent. Okay. Unfortunately, I can't do that for you because you're ACA rated and you're age rated. I have no flexibility there. The rates are what they are. And that's going to be the same in the individual market. Seth knows that. The rates are filed. They are what they are. You have a little bit more flexibility on the individual because everybody can go to different carriers and different plans where you can't do that on the group side. \nKim West:\nOkay, so you think we're looking at at least a 15% increase? \nSheldon:\nI'm thinking. I'm thinking 10 to 15%. \nWilliam Sanders:\nOkay, 10 to 15. Okay. Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. And Sheldon, if I'm understanding you correctly, you know, you don't expect that the individual plans would see any loss savings as opposed to the group plan? \nSheldon:\nBecause it's ACA rated, they're all age rated. You may find cheaper if you go with different benefit designs. So, you know, you got... Of course, young people are going to see better rates than older people. And. Depending on, you know, the level of benefits, if you have somebody that's really healthy. And they can take a high deductible and they're not that old, they can, yeah, they can save some money. So right now you've got composite rates. So it takes all the ages and it does, all the rates for your employees are different, but we did it on a composite basis, so that it's a single employee rate. You're going to have different rates for each employee on this plan. And so your goal, if it makes sense, numbers wise, yes. Have to look at it. I think what he's going to suggest to you is that you'll just come up with a budget and you'll give employees a set amount of money. And then they can go out and find the plan that works for them, spend the money that they want to spend. And then if there's leftover, they can help pay for medical costs, things like that. So your goal, what I see you have to analyze, is your younger people are going to get it cheaper than your older people. Are you going to reimburse them less than your older people? I mean, those are things you, if you decide to go this route, is. You'll work with Seth on that. To determine your, you know, your reimbursement arrangements and things like that with your employees. But again, since it's all ACA rated, I know like last year we went from Anthem to Sentara because Sentara's rates were better. You'll have more flexibility as far as carriers with this, because you'll be able to shop it with different carriers versus one carrier. Just have to see how the numbers work out. \nSeth Wood:\nI don't know if Seth may have something to throw in there. No, no, just to chime in, and great to meet you, Sheldon, too. Like, that's fairly accurate. Like, sometimes the numbers shake out and it looks fantastic. Sometimes it's no difference in savings. It just really depends upon the group. It depends upon not just the age range, the states, the locations, all of the above. This year has probably been the wildest year in healthcare history in 30 years. From any broker, any partner that we worked with, increasing rates, just given the overutilization post COVID, the carriers have increased their costs dramatically, even on the individual marketplace. But historically, you know, I think 25 to 35% of in grouping rate increases year over year on average. Now, that's including everybody, right? Not just you like nationwide. So some businesses have had an eight to 10% to 6% to whatever you guys have. Um, but. For individual plans, on average, it's been about 6% year-over-year. This year, nationwide, there was a big boost to about 20%, which is the first time it's ever risen that high. So still, year-over-year, it's about 8% on average, including that, we find. But I think if it made sense not to put the cart before the horse, if we do look at this, we'd do more of a census where we could run and do some number crunching and just see what your budget is. I heard you say just a couple follow-ups. You are, is it? you're a group? are you over 50 full-time equivalents? Is that correct? Okay, no, not. \nKim West:\nCurrently, we're at 34. 34 total. \nSeth Wood:\nOkay, gotcha. And then how many? how many are enrolled currently in in your plan? Um, maybe 20. \nSheldon:\nI think it's 18. 18. \nSeth Wood:\nOkay, okay, yeah, so you're, you're under the affordability threshold for ACA. Right. What that means is you have flexibility in what you can offer your team. There's no management of the numbers. If you want to offer them 300 bucks, 500 bucks, whatever that is, I'll walk you through that in a minute. But overall, this model, you know, people will come to us looking at this model, look at us for at least the cost savings, for sure. That's the first thing. Or maybe it's to give their employees more choice, or it's a combination of everything. The ACA does have advantages if there are issues with, like any risk pool issues like people getting sick and then your cost increasing because one person gets sick. Sometimes that's a thing. None of these plans are underwritten, meaning they can only charge you based on age and location on the individual market period. So group sometimes is different where they can with this. They can't disqualify you for pre-existing conditions. They can't take anything into account except your age. So if your population, to Sheldon's point, is a lot older, or you have a lot more dependents, sometimes it's not as competitive. But, you know, we can definitely look at the costs if it makes sense, and see if it's your best avenue, or if there's another one, because we do have some time for you today before March to look into this. So, and then Sheldon, really quick for you. Are you familiar with that? Have you worked with us before? \nSheldon:\nOK, OK, cool. \nSeth Wood:\nSo do we just find out about that through an internet search, or just like a word of mouth? Or that's what I'm still trying to understand? I guess you found it. \nWilliam Sanders:\nYeah, it was just through internet searches, you know, just looking into, you know, the program type that, you know, my wife's company implemented. And we're one of the first companies to pop up in the search. \nSeth Wood:\nOkay, cool. So just, just a high level view of us, like the, the ICHRA, this space. Started in 2018. It's a really bad acronym, to be honest. You probably have not heard of it. If you have, great, before this, but it's not something you're going to ever think about in a conversation with somebody to talk about, usually. It's a bipartisan policy, which is rare. So there's a lot of support in DC. Everything's still to this day for this policy. We as a company have been around three or four years, probably. After COVID, we've seen a huge influx of small businesses, especially looking at this because of the pros of what it provides. And also the technology now is caught up to make this a really smooth system. So it feels the way we do it, it feels just like a group offering, except you're going through thatch, basically. So your employees are not going out on the marketplace, buying a plan, having to ask for reimbursement. That does not happen here. So it's directly through the carriers that you pay the monthly premiums, like you do on a group plan. And your employees basically just get any over just deducted out of payroll, just like you would expect anything else. So just to kind of align for a minute just with how it works. So you can just share my screen really quickly here. Can you see this on your end? OK. Yes. OK, perfect. So just to just you, Mayor, you kind of brought this up. And Sheldon kind of has an understanding already here, because he's worked with it, probably, but the way that it works, you're not going out and buying and choosing a plan every year for your team. You're not having to do that one size fits all approach where you're choosing every year, you're paying the increase, you're doing what you can. You're working with Sheldon to try to get you some really, really, really good rates. With this model, you're just kind of getting out of that game altogether. Because you might be over-insuring some people, you might be under-insuring some people, depending upon how you approach your plan strategy. Your job is to basically just provide a pre-tax allowance through Thatch to your team. So, like in the example image, like if you're giving an employee, let's just say $750 or something, $750, that money is all pre-tax. Your employee basically goes through Thatch and chooses a health care plan that's best for them. And then they can choose a plan that costs less. So let's just say they choose a plan because they're maybe younger, healthier. They choose a plan that only costs $500 out of that $750 that you're giving them. This is optional, so they can have that leftover $250 every month, and they could use that for qualified medical expenses, things like prescriptions, co-pays. There's also a number of items that are compliance, things like wellness, fertility, mental health, That you can use those dollars through a letter of medical necessity. I got an ergonomical chair from my back through that fund. There are ways that you can utilize that to add a little bit more value to your offering. If you want to do that, you can. It kind of acts like that HSA, but it's not. It's or an FSA, I guess. But if you also say, hey, I just want to have all of my dollars only go to the premium, you could turn that off too. And say, I'm just going to contribute just to the premiums and do that extra amount. It's really up to your business. If you give $750 and vice versa, the employee chooses a plan that costs $850. You're only giving up to $750. That's your budget. And then that $100 is just going to get deducted out of payroll, like you would have anything else on the split between that. \nWilliam Sanders:\nDoes that make sense? \nSeth Wood:\nGo ahead. Yeah. \nWilliam Sanders:\nYeah, that all makes sense. What happens for employees who completely opt out of health insurance? \nSeth Wood:\nThey don't get any allowance at all. And it's not going to their pockets. It's going through thatch to the carriers. So, like, if there's a leftover amount, they'd have to choose a plan to get any allowance from you, period. And then, if there is leftovers, they would have that thatched debit card. We also validate and verify everything that's spent. They have to prove a receipt to make sure it's not, you know, pizza or something that's not qualified. Medical expense. It has to be something realistic. \nKim West:\nSo, Seth, does each person have the choice of whether they want to go with an anthem or a sentara, or a... Whatever, or is we pick a plan and they have to pick a plan within that carrier? \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, so they get whatever is local to them. Are all your employees in Virginia? \nKim West:\nWe have a couple that are in a couple of different states. \nSeth Wood:\nOkay. Yeah, so it would be wherever they live, basically, and they're all the options available. So, for example, I'll send this link to you, but... What is a good Zip code we could use? We can pull up some options just so you can see. \nKim West:\n230-60. 230-60? \nSeth Wood:\nYep. And then, Virginia, and then what's an average age? I'd say 45. \nWilliam Sanders:\nYeah, 45. \nSeth Wood:\nOkay. So for Virginia, 65 options are available. Anthem, United, Oscar, and Cigna. Okay. And the lowest, filtering by lowest premium, we have a bronze, 397. For 45, let's go up to a silver or gold, which is just a higher. So 518 is a Cigna silver EPO. If they have special needs, maybe they're going to the doctor more, maybe they want to buy up and go to a gold plan, which is a lot more comprehensive. 5.27 is a starting point per month total for that premium. And then you would just be contributing a portion towards that, right? Whatever your budget is. Okay. \nWilliam Sanders:\nAnd I assume this program allows options for like, having spouse included or family plan options and stuff as well. Yeah, yeah. \nSeth Wood:\nIt's up to, we'll ask for dependents when they start enrolling. Do they want to add any children, spouses? If you have in your strategy want to contribute, you can optionally contribute towards that too. You don't have to. It's just up to however you guys want to spend your dollars. But they would just pay additional out-of-pocket for that. \nWilliam Sanders:\nHistorically, we just offered a $300 allowance towards whatever plan they select. \nKim West:\nWhat that has basically covered is our minimum requirement for an affordable healthcare. \nSeth Wood:\nGot it. Yeah. And on the individual marketplace, that's totally fine. It won't be, you can offer any dollar amount you want, technically under 50, with the ACA, with the ICRA. So if you want to contribute 350, 250, 300, whatever you wanted to do, you can keep it the same. So the only difference is, you'll see, and to Sheldon's point earlier, which is valid, is like, the cost for people that are older are going to be higher than younger. So you can do flat rate. You could do a Flat, keep it simple, totally fair to do that. If you do want to do more of an age-banded, dynamic approach, where you're giving some people who are slightly older just a little bit more. So they have equal buying power and somebody who's younger, same plans, we can do that too, or we can at least investigate that with you to see what the cost would look like. It's just really up to, however, makes the most sense for you as a business, and then your employees. \nWilliam Sanders:\nAnd then what... Something that Sheldon had brought up was that he didn't think that... So individuals over the age of 65 would be able to use this. They would have to use the Medicare plan. Is that accurate? Correct. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, there's no Medicare plans on the individual marketplace. So anyone who's on Medicare, anyone who's over 65 would just we can help them enroll in Medicare. We have a team that does that, but they would need to choose a Medicare plan. They would still get an allowance, though, through the Icra from you. So you could still contribute $300 a month towards them to get. Reimbursed for their Medicare costs. \nWilliam Sanders:\nThat's the difference. Generally, the cost of the Medicare plans are those similar to these normal plans, or would it be... \nSeth Wood:\nMedicare is very inexpensive, usually. So I see I can't speak to everything about Medicare. I'm not there yet. But I've seen a few hundred dollars for a Medicare plan. \nKim West:\nAnd Daniel, I can tell you, like with Dennis's Medicare, he has... Um, the isn't the D. That's everything covered. \nSheldon:\nC. C. Okay, advantage plan. \nKim West:\nOkay, yeah, the advantage plan, which is like an HMO. And he has a zero payment. And I don't know what that is reflective of. If it's just off of his, you know, salary from Medicare or how they come up with that price. SHELDON Do you know? \nSheldon:\nUm, it depends on the carrier, but a lot of them come in with a zero premium and then it works. Like you said, like an HMO, they have a network they got to go to. They have co-pays. They have out-of-pocket maximums. Works more like insurance. But it does have drug coverage and some other things. And there's some that have a cost. Supplement plans have a cost. They work a little bit different. They don't have networks. Anybody who takes Medicare has to take a supplement. And they pretty much fill in the gaps that Medicare doesn't pay for. So, benefit-wise, you'll get a better bang for your buck with a supplement. But cost-wise, you get a better bang with an advantage plan. So it all depends on how often you go to the doctor, what you use it for. My question, Seth, to you would be, since they've got to pay for part B Medicare, Regardless where you go to the Advantage plan or supplement, which this year is $185 a month, and that goes up every year, and based on your income, it could be even more than that. Can they get reimbursed for that through the HRA? Do you know? \nSeth Wood:\nThe ICRA, they can get reimbursed for Medicare specifically. \nSheldon:\nPart B premium? \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, let me double check on that. But yeah, it's usually reimbursable. I'll follow up in an email. \nSheldon:\nFrom what I understand, it should be because they just say funds can be used for that. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, there's like, supplemental may be different, but B should be covered, I assume. So, but yeah, good questions. It's really going to be just the folks that are obviously they're going to enroll. If you need help, we can help, Sheldon. If we did this, Sheldon could help, too, but we would just get them, make sure they're enrolled. And then they just go into that. They have a batch account like everyone else, and they can just. Request that reimbursement for their monthly spend or their monthly premium costs. If you did allow leftover dollars, then they could utilize qualified medical expenses. If you said, no, I just want to give that towards those premiums, then it would just go solely towards the premiums of Medicare, just like anything else. \nSheldon:\nDo you have advantage plans and supplements on your site, or do they have to go out and get those on their own? \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, they'd have to go out and get those, right? So they can go through your help, through a broker, through the calling directly on the website, the SSA website. There's a number of ways they can get enrolled. \nKim West:\nNow, would this be a reason because RCs would be changing their insurance plan? Would this be other than open enrollment period for a Medicare person if they've always had the hour card? Commercial insurance. If all of a sudden, now I need to go to Medicare, this is an allowable reason. \nSeth Wood:\nYes. When you switch to this model, the Icra or whatever, if you don't remember that name, it's okay. If whenever you switch to Thatch, if you did this, that creates a special enrollment window. So you're able to join this anytime in the year. And you're also, for anyone on Medicare, this is also a special enrollment window as well because their health benefits are changing. So they have the ability to switch because they can't get it any other way. Right. So they need health care. So that's an allowable reason. Just like you'd expect if somebody moved in the year or had any changes to their life, like any other health plan on the ICRA, that's the same thing. You can change your benefits. I had another thought there. One thing I also always want to bring up to, just to get ahead of it, because it is something unique to the Icra, because it's managed by the IRS. There are some tax considerations for ownership. So are you guys, how are you guys taxed? Is it a C-Corp, an S-Corp? \nKim West:\nS-Corp. \nSeth Wood:\nOkay. Because of, and I'm not a CPA, so you can talk to your CPAS about this. So I don't know, I can't answer anything beyond this, but I can tell you for ownership specific. So if you're an owner of more than 2% of an S-Corp, because the S-Corp is a pre-tax incentive. Owners themselves are not able to participate in the ICRA. Okay, so like, that means because the dollars are already pre-tax and ownership does get some tax advantages, like, they're able to usually write off their health care costs and things like that through CPAs. The IRS sees it as kind of a form of double dipping. So basically, any owners would just have to go on and get a marketplace plan post-tax, not go through the ICRA. We could help them select a plan. Our team can walk them through that, but it just could not go through the Icra specifically. \nKim West:\nSo you're saying, anyone that owns more than what percent of the company? Two percent. Two percent is not eligible for this plan? Correct. \nSeth Wood:\nFor the Icra specifically, to go through pre-tax dollars. \nWilliam Sanders:\nOkay. It's still to be facilitated through the system, though. \nSeth Wood:\nYou know, it's it's on my Christmas list for next year. Yes, we're building this out, so yes, that's a number, that's a very big request. In the meantime, it's not a perfect thing, but we get. We have, like, a licensed advisor. If we needed to, you know, Shelton could help, too. But we could get somebody to walk through the plan selection on the marketplace to make sure you're they're selecting a plan that works. \nWilliam Sanders:\nYeah, I mean, I think that would be kind of prohibitive to us. Just because out of the 18 people that participate in our health plan, five of us are part owners of the company. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, that's just something that's IRS mandated. So we have a lot. I'd say 90% of our customers are S-Corp. So given your situation, it's very valid, though. I mean, it's five people out of whoever's enrolled. So I hear that. It's just, it's a double-debt. Yeah, yeah. No, that's fair. That's totally fair. Usually we have like one or two, maybe, and we can work around that. There's also the possibility, I can't speak to this totally, But if you're not eligible, you've had other customers work with their broker and get a group plan specifically for the owner. Because they don't qualify anymore for the ICRA. That might be compliant, but you would have to just, yeah, you would not be able to participate for pre-tax reasons, specifically. \nKim West:\nSo, Sheldon, what are your thoughts or comments on that for knowing us? \nSheldon:\nAre you telling me that they cannot even get part of the HRA? They can't be part of that? \nSeth Wood:\nCorrect. \nSheldon:\nYeah. \nSeth Wood:\nFrom the I.R.S standpoint, yes. \nSheldon:\nSo then for you guys, what would happen is you'd have to go get an individual plan, which I could help you do. And then, if you wanted to pay for part of it, you could reimburse yourself, but it'd have to be salary dollars. You'd have to pay taxes on it. Reported as income personally. So tax wise would be just a little bit different for you guys. If that makes sense. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah. Yeah. And I totally get it. I mean, that's, that's definitely something I always bring up. Because I wanted to make sure, you know, we don't go too far down the rabbit hole, But for anyone who's not an owner, of course, there's no difference. It doesn't matter. It's just due to the tax advantage situation for ownership for the IRS, from what I understand. Don't even get me started on that. I can't speak to anything else beyond that. I don't know what the ruling is, why the ruling is, but it's just the way it is. So, like, beyond, besides that piece, which may be the biggest negative impact here, you know, everything else is done through Thatch, right? So the team would just go through, select the plan, enroll, and then they'd basically... Have the direct plan. It's in their name, but Thatcher is there to support them. If there's questions, issues, they can jump on a call with us. They can talk. Sheldon can help, too. Whatever you guys would do, we could do. And then you're paying the premium for the employee as long as they're employed. After they leave, if they did leave the company, they would start paying the premiums for themselves. They can keep the plan, which is nice, right? It just switches them. \nKim West:\nHow does the dental envision? Work into here? \nSeth Wood:\nIt's up to you. So just for your sake, like, we can do dental vision through thatch. I will say, though, like we do, we obviously use our own product here, right? It'd be crazy if we didn't. We do. We also keep our dental vision separate on a group plan because the rates for dental vision have not been as affected at all by the medical plans. Like we see. And normally, they're pretty competitive externally. And so if you have something today that works, you can keep it. Like, that doesn't change anything here. \nKim West:\nI don't think we've had a price increase on health provision since we started with you, with this. Have we, Sheldon? \nSheldon:\nIt hasn't in the last few years. \nKim West:\nYeah. \nSeth Wood:\nDental vision is pretty, pretty stable. \nSheldon:\nCan they get reimbursed? Because some of them are just voluntary. They're paying for it out of their own pocket. They can get reimbursed for that through this, right? Yeah. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, it's very tough. If there's leftover dollars, if they choose a plan that gives them a little flexibility, there may or may not be depending, obviously, the plan that they choose. And whatever you contribute. But if there were any, in theory, yes, they could use that towards the dental vision co-pays or anything like that. \nSheldon:\nEven if it doesn't go through you, even if they keep their current plan, they could still get reimbursed. If they submitted, I paid this much for premium. \nSeth Wood:\nNo, no, you'd only get those dollars if you choose a medical plan with the ICRA. Right. \nKim West:\nBut could they say it was their own dental or vision that they currently have and get reimbursed through that if there's extra monies there? \nSeth Wood:\nOh, yes. Yeah. If there's leftover dollars after the health care, which, again, may or may not be depending upon the allowance, the plans. If there was, yes. In theory, they would just submit a reimbursement through the Thatch portal, and then we could help reimburse that pre-tax. Yes. Sorry. Thanks for the clarification. So. Who do you guys just quickly, high level stuff, who do you guys use for payroll today as well? \nKim West:\nWe have a CPA. \nSeth Wood:\nA CPA? Perfect. Okay. So the way that it works, we're a tech forward company. I know we're almost at time. So i apologize. That's on me today. But we can continue the conversation if you still feel like you want to after. But basically, we do integrate. So you can add your roster in through simple first class. First name, last name, email. We'd send out the invites to that. I'll send you a link to a walk through of the onboarding experience for an employee. So you can really see that. And some other links today, But basically, we would generate a deduction report for you, for your CPA at the top of the year. You just send that over. It's a CSV file and would show them what to deduct out of payroll for everybody based on the plan selection. \nKim West:\nAnd that's what we do now. \nSeth Wood:\nOkay. That would be no different. So the managing it is very straightforward. And so, you know, what I will say is I'll just for next steps, you know, cause I know we're at time. And I, I do apologize that I have, let me double check my calendars to make sure I have, if I have any extra time today, I'd love to. Okay. Actually, I do have a few minutes. If you guys have a few minutes, I can still keep talking. But great. So like, if you, yeah, if you want to see an employee experience, I can show you that. But basically, it's very straightforward. You're just sending out invitations to your team via email. They're creating a thatch account and then choosing their plans. That's a very intuitive product. So it's 85% people go through it, do it fine. It's even mobile optimized, especially if people are older. They don't always have computers at home, sometimes. So they can still go through their account and do that. But they can also jump on a same day call with a... Licensed advisor, if needed, to talk to anybody about the plan choice. And then, after that's done, so they're selecting a plan. We also have our support team to work with them in the carriers. If anything pops up directly, you're not going to be the person to go through for the claims or any, you know, Sheldon, too. Like, it's really just going to be basically us supporting them and working through that. When I enrolled in a plan last year, earlier this year, I, There was a delay on the carrier to process my enrollment, even though weeks before Thatch had submitted the enrollment. So the Thatch team stepped in and worked and reached out to the carrier directly to get everything backdated and corrected as it should be. So things like that can happen, but the team kind of takes care of all that for you guys, so administratively it's really straightforward. Um, we administer Cobra, we do everything you'd expect. Cobra's a little different on the group, on the individual plans versus group, but we still legally administer that. If an employee leaves, you know, we'll take care of that piece, um, and get that started. We'll also manage the 1095, all that stuff, everything for compliance to keep you compliant. We basically do on the backend. So for... \nKim West:\nIs there an extra charge for administering the Cobra and the 1095s? \nSeth Wood:\nNo, no, that's just included in thatch, pretty much. Yeah. Through those Thatch admin fees, which are on our site. Did you guys already see that on our website? \nKim West:\nI've not looked at that. \nWilliam Sanders:\nI didn't really do much looking through the site and stuff. I just, just when I saw the book, the game I Call, I just went ahead and did that. \nSeth Wood:\nPerfect. Yeah. So our admin fees, so doing everything like it's standard, is 45 PEPM. So, $45 per employee that enrolls per month, and then $50 flat to the business just for compliance. And that's it. So there's no implementation or anything else. It's just pretty straightforward. Whoever's enrolling in your company. Okay. \nKim West:\n$45 per person and then $15 flat rate per month. Correct. $45 per person per month. Yeah. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah. Whoever enrolled. Whoever enrolled. $1,000 fee per month. If you, yeah, depending upon if you have 16, 17, well, you wouldn't be enrolling through Thatch as ownership, but your employees themselves, correct? Sure. What else can I do to be helpful? Just trying to get a sense of feedback here, because I know the S-Corp is a big deal. \nWilliam Sanders:\nYeah, I mean, I think you've answered what questions we've had and stuff. And unfortunately, I do think that the ownership thing is going to be prohibitive for us proceeding with this right now. But we are going to talk to Sheldon about it some more and possibly get y'all to look into what the cost differences would be for the employees. I mean, if the benefit to the employee significantly outweighs the... Negative impact to the owners. We may still consider it. \nSeth Wood:\nUm, yeah, but it's definitely going to be something that we have to. \nWilliam Sanders:\nYou know, look at the numbers and compare, and you know, see, totally. \nSeth Wood:\nIt's going to be totally so like, as far as like what we do. If you guys still are interested, take your time, figure it out. You have a we have time before, yeah, that timeline. \nWilliam Sanders:\nWe're trying to get a head start on it. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah. We can definitely run a cost analysis, get your census information, and we have a tool that makes it easier to compare. So you can see what plans, what the dollars are going to get, how does the total cost, including the thatch fees, everything. Does this work? Ideally, too, once you get your renewal rates for next year, that would be great. So that way we can really, apples to apples, see how the costs overall shake up, because we already have the 2026 numbers here for that piece. So it's really just to the. Is there cost savings or is there flexibility, a little bit more flexibility with this to help you guys. And that can make, make that a little bit easier to manage. If you're having to be an escort boner, knowing you're really saving money. That's, that's kind of the win for everybody, but also getting your employees a little bit more choice. So totally fair. Sheldon, I know we haven't worked together. Feel free to reach out to me directly. If you happy to walk me through how we work with our partners. We have a lot of broker partners who most of our business comes through you as well. So happy to walk you through that on our end. To support you with this. If this is something the group does, consider more. But please just, uh, everyone have a great holiday. Let me know if. \nSheldon:\nYeah, you too. I just got a couple quick questions. Yeah, my whole purpose, I want what's best for them. And if this is best, I'm going to be honest and tell them that. Because it's individual plans, some people may be able to get a subsidy. Now, I don't know. They may be going away. They may not. Who knows? But if they remain, can they do on-exchange plans through you? And do you help them with the? Because it's a pain in the butt going through healthcare.gov, as you probably know. Do you help them through that process? I don't know if anybody there would qualify for a subsidy or not. \nSeth Wood:\nThat's the question. So you can, With this model, if the allowance is considered affordable, they wouldn't qualify for the subsidy through the ICRA. Because their employer is, it's the way for the ACA to kind of push them towards the employer, basically. If they were getting $5 a month or something crazy low, right? Like, that's on an affordable allowance. Like, then the they would then be able to get a subsidy on the marketplace and just go through that. They wouldn't go through thatch because we can't bring a stipend, not stipend, a subsidy, a plan with a subsidy into thatch. So, like, the employee could go on the marketplace and bring a plan if they wanted to. \nSheldon:\nThey would be qualified for a subsidy. They could opt out of this and go. Yeah. \nSeth Wood:\nIf they wanted to do that. Yeah. It's probably based on your point. Unlikely, they would. Given their salary and then the allowance, they probably won't qualify. But that's an option if they did. Yeah. \nSheldon:\nOkay. Another question I have is because these are individual plans, let's say they do this March 1. Would they get an increase in January 1 because all individual plans go up January 1? Or would these rates hold for 12 months and then? 12 months. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, yeah. So the 2026 rates are set. We're already set for the whole year. For the year. \nSheldon:\nBut on December 31, would they switch over January 1 to a higher? Would the increase hit them in mid-year? \nSeth Wood:\nFor 2027? Yeah. So, yeah, the plan. So every year the rates get finalized at the end of October for the next year. \nSheldon:\nAnd they start January 1. \nSeth Wood:\nSo if they were starting to backtrack. So if they're starting in the spring of this next year, pretending that, like, they would have the 2026 rates you're seeing through the whole year. And then. The next beginning of the next year, their rates would increase, it would go up before a year was up. \nSheldon:\nThey wouldn't have an increase January one, yeah, they wouldn't have an increase at all next year, but the following year, they might have January 2027, they would have an increase. \nSeth Wood:\nSo they're gonna go full 12 months, okay, the deductible would obviously be a partial deductible, too. Um, you can do things around that you can offer. Like sometimes people do little bonuses if they want post tax to just help offset that a little bit and stuff like that. But overall. Yeah, they can join any point. We have people that join mid-year, but the rates will be updated. And then it moved you to a universal 1-1 after that with the ICRA. So you're always on a 1-1 renewal. \nSheldon:\nOkay, gotcha. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, good questions, though. But yeah, I'll give you, everyone will have resources. I'll send you some links. The plan link, the tool that I showed, I'll send that. You can go in and see the plans for different states, different employees, see the kind of options they're going to have. If you do want to explore this more, no pressure there, either way. Just let us know. We can, I think the next step is always just to look at your numbers, to see, kind of, does it make sense? We can walk you through that piece. And then you can see the two options of doing a flat dollar amount or a dynamic amount where you're giving somewhat older people a little more. You can see if that is helpful and the cost difference there if you wanted to do that. So that's just how we like to approach it. But yeah, let me know how I can be helpful. Otherwise, I hope you guys have a great holiday. \nSheldon:\nThank you, too. \nSeth Wood:\nMerry Christmas. \nWilliam Sanders:\nI appreciate your time, Seth. We'll talk about this internally and get with Sheldon and stuff. Once we start collecting all the information and stuff for the renewal, we'll get with you as far as running comparisons for numbers. Definitely. \nSeth Wood:\nYeah, sounds great. Just keep us in the loop, either way. Not this year, maybe next future years. Happy to help. \nKim West:\nThanks, Seth. \nWilliam Sanders:\nThank you, too. \nSeth Wood:\nBye. \n",

The employer has been fully covering the premium costs for employees. They work with a broker through Northwestern Mutual for their benefits.

Their accountant is described as \"old school\" and still uses pen and paper methods. They do not have direct deposit capabilities and still issue paper checks to employees. This suggests they do not use any modern benefits administration platform (such as Ease, Rippling, or Zenefits) and likely manage benefits administration manually without integrated payroll systems or digital tools.\n\nThe lack of payroll integration and reliance on manual processes indicates that benefits administration workflows are handled through traditional methods rather than automated platforms."

            "transcript": "Taryn Livingstone:\nHey, Michelle, I just saw your email. Good morning. Hey, good morning. I just, I'm reading your email right now, so I just saw, did you figure out how to get your phone connected? \nFREESTATE AUTO:\nYep, I sure did. Oh, amazing. Perfect. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOkay, great. Sorry about that. I honestly am very, like, I know Slack enough to, like, know Slack when it comes, or I just said Slack, I meant to say, Zoom. Oh my goodness. I know it enough to know it enough, although when it comes to switching around, I'm not the best, but thank you for figuring that out. That's, that's awesome. Sure. Sure. Well, anywho, I'm excited to chat this morning. Thanks so much for grabbing time with me and taking the time. And my goal, really with this call is just to learn more about where your head is at regarding benefits and insurance for the coming year. And then we'll see if Thatch might be able to help. So with that quick intro on my end, I'm Taryn. On the business team, mainly focused on companies that are less than 20 employees, hence why we are chatting right now. And Yeah, I'd love to kick it over to you for a quick intro, and then please tell me what sparked your interest in Thatch. So we're a small auto repair shop in Capitol Heights, Maryland. \nFREESTATE AUTO:\nWe have about 10 employees. Not all of them need health insurance. I want to say we have like maybe six or seven that do. We do. We have a broker with Northwestern Mutual that we've been using, but I can't say that we're like 100% happy with them. And what my boss wants to do is offer like a $400. If you call it a stipend, or what he wants to offer. $400 for employees to put towards their health insurance, whichever plan they pick. And then, you know, if they pick, like, you know, one that's more expensive than the $400, then the employees are responsible for the difference. He has been paying for a group plan through Kaiser, but with Kaiser, they're only like, we have a few of us, myself included, that our doctors don't participate with Kaiser. And, you know, after going to the same doctor for over 15 years, I don't really want to switch to a, you know, Kaiser-specific doctor. And Kaiser doctors don't take any other insurance other than Kaiser. So it's kind of... We want to find something that will be able to work for everyone. But we're new to the, what's it called, ICRA. We haven't had an Icra before, so we're not 100% sure how it even works, or what's required, or if it's even the best option for us. So we're just kind of in the research stages now. We did sign up for... Or we did say that we'll go ahead and do like a Kaiser Silver Group plan, but hopefully we can. If we decide to go with that, we shouldn't have an issue like canceling that as long as it's before December 1st or January 1st, right? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, generally speaking, you have this whole window to sign up and cancel plans. So you should be fine there. \nFREESTATE AUTO:\nOkay, perfect. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYes. All right. Perfect. Yeah, this is great context, by the way, Michelle. Thanks so much for filling me in here. Is there anything else that would help in terms of, like, what you want to learn from the call, or anything like that? \nFREESTATE AUTO:\nJust kind of what our options are. I know there's, like, I don't know if it's government regulations or what, you know, so we want to make sure that we're compliant, that we have a plan that, you know, we have options that are going to work for all of our employees. The youngest on the plan is our manager's two-year-old, and the oldest would be, we do have an employee who's 64, almost 65. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nHe'll be 65, I think, in June or July. \nFREESTATE AUTO:\nSo we want to have an option for the employees who, you know, are going to be required to go on. I'm not sure if it's Medicare or Medicaid, whatever. One is 65 and older. Like, we want to, you know, even though they're getting Medicare or Medicaid, I know there's still some expenses that they have to pay out of pocket. So we still want, you know, we want to be able to give them the $400 that all the other employees are getting as well. So that they can put that towards whatever health care they need to come in good health so they can keep working on vehicles. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nTotally. Yeah, that also is a great thing to flag. So, on our end, we fully support Medicare with the stipends. So that's no issue for us in terms of making sure they're all good to go. \nFREESTATE AUTO:\nAll right. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, perfect. Okay, so I think, can you actually, would you be able to see my screen if I share it? Yeah. \nFREESTATE AUTO:\nOh, perfect. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOkay, so you don't have to. \nFREESTATE AUTO:\nI can see you. You just don't. I don't have a camera on this computer. Oh, gotcha. No, no worries at all. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOkay, perfect. Well, in that case, here's what I'll do is I'll give you the overview of that, just to give you the nuts and bolts. And, like, answer pretty much any other questions you have regarding how our Icra model works. And then after that, I'll show you how you can actually go and get a quote for yourself. So how that works, basically, is you just simply make a quick account with us. It's the no strings attached account. You kind of just sign up and then you'll go into the allowance calculator, as we call it. It's basically a quote tool. And then from there, what you can do is you'll actually be able to upload your employees, Set the budget at $400 flat. And then from that, also see what the plan options are that will be available to you. So really, it makes it very transparent as far as what you're getting with with this model. Okay, perfect. Yeah. All right. So here, I'm going to share my screen. Can you see this right here? Yes. Perfect. Okay. So to dive into the slides here, so kicking things off, at Thatch, our mission is to build a healthcare system people love. And so how do we do that? Well, right now, generally speaking, the way that small group insurance works is. It tries to be a one size fits all model that usually ends up being a no size fits any. So you actually hit the nail on the head with this. Right. So, for example, that means if you might have some people in the group who want Kaiser, some other people who want United, No one can end up getting the, you know, the carriers that they all want across the board. And it also means, too, if you're hiring. Right. You might have to abandon a doctor you want in order to get health insurance through your company. So for those reasons. Plus, just the fact that if there is anyone that's a little bit more expensive one year, the premiums are going to increase across the board. It makes it so that this model is just a bit outdated and usually just not very flexible to the way that modern health care works. So getting into that here, and also this is just an intro to Icarus in general, How we work to solve this problem, if you will, is we let you set a budget. And with that budget, which is a pre-tax budget also, so that's another. One of the benefits that you get with a NICRA. Any employee can then buy healthcare how they'd like. So they'd start with first buying that premium, and then with any leftover dollars, if there are any, that can go towards prescriptions, co-pays, but also telehealth vendors. Sort of works like an FSA. I know with your group, you mentioned that most likely it's going to just be that flat $400 amount. So you'll also have employee contribution on your end. And and so how that works is. The employee contribution when you buy a plan through Thatch will also be pre-tax. And what we would do is very similar to a group model. We would just integrate directly with your payroll provider. So that as people are getting paid, they don't even need to think about paying for their health care. It would just happen automatically on their end. \nFREESTATE AUTO:\nSo our problem is that our accountant is old school. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nLike, he's still pen and paper. \nFREESTATE AUTO:\nSo we don't have direct deposits here. We still get paper checks. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nGotcha. Oh, paper checks. Okay. Yeah. \nFREESTATE AUTO:\nYeah. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nNo, that's no worries. \nFREESTATE AUTO:\nIt's easy to say in 2025. Yeah, I know. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nI know. But not something that I haven't heard before. We can definitely work with that. I'll just check back on my end to see what the process would be like. Similarly, though, it would probably be very similar to what you've already done with group insurance, where it would, again, just be a payroll deduction. Might be a little more manual, but we'll see if we can make it a little easier on your end, too. All right. Yeah. Any other questions on how this general flow works? Nope. \nFREESTATE AUTO:\nAll right. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nPerfect. So now we'll dive in a little bit with our plan selection information here. So with... Our plans In any given area, we've partnered with around five carriers with over 20 plan options. That's the average for each Zip code. So this is giving people basically more option than ever before when they're getting health insurance in a group like setting. But, of course, like with optionality, we also want to make sure people are supported to make decisions as best as possible. And so that's where we come in again, primarily as a tech platform. What we can do is actually take into account. Who someone's doctor is, or any medications that they're on to recommend a carrier and a plan that is going to fit their needs best. Similarly, we also have a concierge support team. That's basically a bunch of plan support specialists who are working with people every single day to advise on plans and kind of guide them through also. So if you did want to talk to a live person and have an actual one-on-one, dedicated time with them, that's something we offer, too. All right. And then this, so now this is actually something. \nFREESTATE AUTO:\nDoes it cost extra for the concierge support? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nNope, that's included. \nFREESTATE AUTO:\nYeah. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOkay. Yeah, you got it. Definitely a very useful tool, I would say. I always recommend everyone uses it just because it's, I mean, healthcare is very complex. It's always good to get an extra perspective. Yeah. All right. So this actually, this is diving into a perk. You can turn on or off, depending on if you want to offer it. But basically, with what we've done in terms of thinking about, okay, imagine if you have these leftover spending dollars, if you buy a plan that's less expensive than your budget, one thing you could do is go to the Thatch marketplace and buy any of the health vendors you see here. So we've made partnerships with all of these folks. Goal here really being to help supplement um someone's core, uM insurance package. With some of these vendors who are very, very focused on solving one very specific part of health or wellness. So that's something we have here. Again, you can turn it on or off, depending on if you'd like to offer it, But just kind of shows that we're always thinking ahead in terms of what we can do regarding insurance. And then, very lastly, this is just covering all of the nuts and bolts of it. So, you can think of Thatch as an end-to-end medical benefits platform. So we will handle everything from Enrollments, so actually helping people enroll in the plans all the way through to compliance. So everything compliance wise is fully taken care of, making sure the plans are all up to date and good to go with the ACA. All the way through down to receipt verification. So again, that will come into play if there is any leftover funds. That's going to act pretty similarly to an FSA. Where people can say if they go to a doctor visit and they have a copay, they could submit the receipt from their copay to Thatch. We would process that for them. Again, if there are funds there. And then for payroll deductions, we did mention this already. But yes, we handle that also. So for the employee contribution, we'll just make it so that. They also are getting that pre-tax benefit for paying for their insurance through a payroll deduction there. Perfect. Yeah. All right. Well, that's the rundown there. Any questions based on anything I just mentioned there, Michelle? \nFREESTATE AUTO:\nI don't think so. No, I don't think so. All right. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOkay, well, in that case, let me actually zoom on over to this page. I'll show you this. This also, by the way, I'll send you a link after our call where you can go to this exact page yourself and go through the allowance calculator. flow. It's simply like, when you go to Thatch.com and just hit Start now, you'll go through a couple of screens. And then you'll get to this one here. But this is the allowance calculator. So how it works is First, you would upload a list of your employees, which you can do manually, or you can actually just drop a CSV file there as well. So I'm going to go next step. And basically, this is the only information we need, really, is their ZiP code, date of birth, age, which is inherent in date of birth, and then also their number of dependents. And so the reason why we need that information, if I go a couple more screens over. Is that that is the information we will use to calculate allowances. So basically, there are two ways to do allowances. The first way, which it sounds like you've already decided on, is doing that flat dollar amount. So that works very well in terms of it's very straightforward. Everyone gets the same amount. What can happen sometimes, though, is if you do have some disparity between some very young people and older people at the company. What might happen is the younger folks can get further with that $400 than someone who's a little bit older and might have plans that are priced higher, right? And so if you did want to explore it, that's also right here with smart allowances. So what we'll do with this little calculator, which I'll show you in a second, is we'll take into account where someone lives, how old they are, and also how many dependents. They have to recommend a dollar amount that's going to reflect their needs more. So go next. All right. It's kind of a lot going on here, but I'll make it. Oh, look at that. It's already set to 400. Nice. OK, so this is the allowance calculator. So, first step being, you'd select smart allowance or same dollar amount for everyone. So with this one selected, we put in employee allowance as 400. And then what it will show down here is that everyone gets a monthly allowance of $400. Dollars and a couple things to note here. So one thing you can change with the flat amount is you can add more for dependents if you wanted to. So, for instance, if I add an extra 100 if you for the first dependent, it's going to now give people with dependents, um, an extra hundred dollars there. And then, yeah, and then also, too, these little compliance flags. Basically, what this means is that the allowance is unaffordable. What that means you can actually find it over here is that I hover over one of these things. There we go, it's not, the pop up isn't working. That's OK. Basically, what that means is that it's an unaffordable coverage allowance. Now, the thing is, you don't actually have to worry about that as a small employer. It only comes into play compliance wise when you're above 50 full time employees. But what it could mean, though, is that if anyone in your company is qualifying for a government subsidy to get their plan subsidized on the ACA, they could decline coverage with you and use that. That's what that means there. So can you say that again? Because I know we probably will have a few that qualify for the subsidies. Yeah, sure thing. So basically, if you give them an allowance that's below the minimum contribution, and it will tell you what it is. So, like in this case, we're using San Francisco as an example, But the minimum allowance to be affordable for this employee is $584.85. Now, so in this case, because this employee doesn't have the minimum affordable allowance, they could decline coverage with you and just not use the Icra and get their government subsidy instead. Now, if they were offered an affordable allowance to you or by you, then they would instantly be disqualified from using any government subsidy. So that's just what that means there. Okay. Yeah, you got it. \nFREESTATE AUTO:\nSo nobody can get an employer contribution and a government subsidy? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, you just summed it up perfectly, actually. Yes, you got it. They're mutually exclusive. But, of course, it depends. Some people are getting pretty low subsidies, so it doesn't really come into play anyway. So you just want to make sure that you know what your folks are looking for there. Yeah. You got it, and then what you can do, too, is so what you can also check out is like, basically what the employees are going to see. I'll show you another view here. Actually, that'll be a little bit more comprehensive, but this is the one that we have in the quick pop-up. So basically, what this shows is the types of plans that are available in the employees area. And it will also show them some quick information about what the plans are like. What their deductible would be out-of-pocket max, and also how much their contribution would be for each plan, given what their budget is. This, again, is an abbreviated view, but the one that the employee will see will look pretty similar. But have some more information too. So they can actually look at the full plan documents if they want to before making their decision. Yeah, all right, and then, lastly, I'll just touch on smart allowance since again. This is also available to you to play around with if you'd like. Basically, what this is doing is, again, it's taking into account where people are living, how old they are, how many dependents. They have to recommend an amount. So the first thing you would do is you can pick your coverage level. So lowest cost, you can think of as a bronze plan, best fit, silver, better benefits, like giving everyone a gold plan, right? So if we go to best fix, I know you mentioned you have a silver plan now. And we actually go over here. To custom this little tab here, you can toggle around the contributions. So, say that you as an employer want to contribute um, 80 to the silver plans for an employee. You would set it to this. And now. This basically means that your allowance that you're giving them will cover 80 of the silver plans that are available to them. So remember, because this is an Icra which actually didn't, didn't even cover fully. Individual coverage, Health reimbursement arrangement. Um, they can pick whatever individual plan they want, but this more so is saying, based on the budget, you're allowing them access to get this level of plan. Does that make sense? Okay, great. And again, if you do want to do the flat amount, then it will be a lot more straightforward. Just pick that and then you can put it in here. And basically. After that, the next steps to sign up is just hitting review over here. It's going to give you a quick little summary and then you just go through the flow. And we wouldn't actually even need a human in the loop until you want to set up your payroll. That is something that we can help you with doing manually. And then, lastly, to quickly cover fees. So we at that charge a $45 per employee per month fee. So PEPM, similar to a broker fee if you've worked with brokers in the past. And then we also charge $50 per month flat. Compliance fee. So that is just going to be $50 a month, but not including per employee. So it's just $50 total. \nFREESTATE AUTO:\nIt's not $50 per employee. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYou got it. Yeah. So $50 a month, plus the $45 per each employee. So in this actually, to correct myself here, per enrolled employee. So if you only have five employees enrolled, for instance, you're only going to pay for the five that are enrolling. Okay. \nFREESTATE AUTO:\nAnd then, so, um, so, I believe, so. We have 10 employees here. If only seven need health insurance, we don't, does, does the owner have to put $400 in for the three that don't need coverage? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nNo, they would not need to do that. So basically, you would only pay for $45 times 7 plus 50. \nFREESTATE AUTO:\nSo that would just be, yeah, whatever that number is. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nMy mental math is not as good as it used to be. But, yes, yeah, that is the price there. Okay, gotcha. \nFREESTATE AUTO:\nAnd then how long does it take for, like, reimbursement? Like, say, we sign up and, you know, we select that we want to be active January 1st. Are we too late for the January 1st deadline? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOh, great question. I'm glad you asked, that was the other thing I wanted to cover with you is the timeline. So you're not too late. The last day actually to sign up and confirm your account that we have is the 19th. So that's only three days away. That being said, for actually having your employees go through and select their plans, they will have until the 28th. So they do have a bit of, like a week and a half, two weeks buffer time to actually go through and pick a plan. So we're in good time if you do want to move forward, that one one deadline. \nFREESTATE AUTO:\nAnd that would be for coverage January 1st. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYes, you got it. Yep. So, and I'll send you those, I'll follow up with those dates as well, just so that you have them from me too. But anywho, any other questions I can help to clarify? Any hesitations? I'm happy to address. \nFREESTATE AUTO:\nSo, for reimbursement. So... We did a little bit of research, and I had done a meeting in the past with, I think it's called Tasks, T-A-S-K-S, which is also kind of the same kind of company as you guys. The reviews were awful. People were tearing them apart on Reddit. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nReddit is the source of truth. Right. \nFREESTATE AUTO:\nBut one of the concerns. I guess, is that, like, how does it work with the reimbursement? Well, would we even have a reimbursement? Like, if we're just doing the, because honestly, $400 is barely going to cover the monthly premium. So would we even have, like, a reimbursement process? Like, how would that even work? Can we just, can our employees just pick the plan that they want to have and then? Like, that's it, or how does that process work? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, it's a great question. So with the reimbursement, it would basically be from your end. You would connect your business bank account to Thatch. And then when an employee goes through and selects a plan, they would be reimbursed on a monthly basis from your business bank account. So it's essentially going straight from you to the employee, or technically to Thatch, to then pay for the plan on behalf of the employee. So all of that happens automatically in terms of how the cost goes there. Does that make sense? \nFREESTATE AUTO:\nThat's a little scary, though. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, it is a little scary. I can promise you, though, we do have the best engineers in the country working on this. So all of the people that are at our startup are all Silicon Valley engineers who worked on Stripe, Robinhood, many other types of tech companies. So. We actually, with that, have 0% delinquency rate, which is the only, we're the only Icra vendor who can say that, which basically means that we've never missed a payment ever. So, yeah, pretty secure on that note. But yeah, anything else I can help to address? \nFREESTATE AUTO:\nLet's see, what else did I have? It's $45 per month per employee. Employee and $50 compliance, are those the only, like, fees, or is there any other hidden, you know, not hidden, But is there other, any other fees or charges that we need to know about other than just the $45 and the $50? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nGreat question. No. So, we don't have any startup fees, any support fees. All, so our full support staff is, that's just included in being part of that. So we have a team that you can reach out to 24-7 if you never run into anything. You can also hop back on with me, too. We make ourselves very available to folks. But, yeah, to answer your question, those are the only fees. You got it. Okay, perfect. \nFREESTATE AUTO:\nOkay, and what is the process if there's an issue, or, you know, say, there's an issue with coverage or prescriptions or whatever, Or does the employee... Go to Thatch first, or do they go? Do they call, like the whatever insurance company? Yeah, they pick, it's a great question. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nUm, so we, we. Honestly, it depends on the employee. So sometimes we'll have some folks who just are very comfortable calling their insurance company and going straight to them and asking questions about, Oh, hey, why does this get covered? Whatever, whatever have you? Um? That being said, though, on our support side, we also support with that so many times. We'll have someone reach out to us helping with needing help with coverage, or if there was a prescription that got missed, whatever that is. And so we're happy to assist there as well. Okay, perfect. So you basically, so thatch basically acts like a liaison for, between the employer and employee, and the insurance company and the government? Yes. Yeah. You got it. Yeah. So, so basically that, that's it. The way you just phrased it is, is perfect. So we do act almost like a broker. However, instead of just like one person, it's, you have an entire company of people who are kind of in your back corner, ready to help. So, yeah, that's basically it. Okay. \nFREESTATE AUTO:\nOne more question. Do you have thatch for your insurance? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nThat's a great question. You know, I actually do. \nFREESTATE AUTO:\nSo we use thatch at thatch. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nThere you go. Okay. \nFREESTATE AUTO:\nYeah. It's pretty, yeah, yeah. It's pretty good. If the employees aren't using the company they work for for their insurance, then that's a sign. Oh, yeah, I know. I know that would. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nThat would definitely be a sign. Yes, we love Thatch over at Thatch. I'm pretty sure. We have actually like the highest like enrollment rate per person. Um, that we, that we have for the customers, obviously, right, but um, but yeah, it's great, it works, it honestly works very well. And your folks, you said, you're all in, um, California, right? \nFREESTATE AUTO:\nWe're in Maryland, Maryland, Maryland. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOkay, great. yeah, Maryland actually tends to be a really good, um, a really great state for for Icra, too. I'll send over another, I mean, I'll include it in when I follow up with you in just a second, But I can also send over a link that'll let you actually put in a Zip code and then quickly look at the plan options that are available. So you'll be able to even just see from your lens, your employee's lens, what that looks like, too. So, yeah, happy to send that over. But perfect. I'm actually in New York myself, so not too far away. Okay, gotcha. \nFREESTATE AUTO:\nYeah. Are you near the city or are you in the country? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, I'm actually right in the middle of things in Manhattan, so, yeah. \nFREESTATE AUTO:\nOh, goodness, gracious. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nWell, you stay safe up there. Oh, thank you. Yes, we'll do. Are you close to the D.C. Area yourself? \nFREESTATE AUTO:\nOh, yeah. Well, the shop is, like, we're 10 minutes from D.C., really, from the outskirts of D.C. Oh, that's very close. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nNice. Yeah. \nFREESTATE AUTO:\nIt's a little scary at times, but it's all right. Yeah. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, definitely got to be on the lookout, living in the city. It's the way it is. But all right. Anywho, Michelle, it was great to meet you and chat. I'll follow up with more information on thatch and just as a next step, which I already let you know, But next step would be to check out the allowance calculator, play around with it, and then just get comfortable with an allowance amount that you like. 400 works, then perfect. We can get started and then we can go from there. \nFREESTATE AUTO:\nOkay, perfect. That sounds good. Thank you so much. I'll follow up soon. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah. Have a great one. Good job. Bye-bye. \n",

Key Points Discussed:\n\n- Employer's Interest in ICHRA: The primary motivation for Salvado Law Offices to consider an ICHRA is to manage the 2026 renewal costs and reduce administrative workload. The current Kaiser plan is set to increase by 13%, prompting the need for a more cost-effective solution. The ICHRA offers potential monthly savings of $1,654.50 if all employees enroll, though currently, only 7 employees are enrolled. The Thatch platform provides administrative benefits by handling compliance, payroll integration, and employee support. Employees are particularly interested in the flexibility to choose from 43 plans across CareFirst, Kaiser, and UnitedHealthcare, offering HMO, POS, and PPO options.\n\n- ICHRA Structure Proposed: The proposed ICHRA includes a 50% employer contribution based on a 50th percentile silver plan, matching the current Kaiser plan's deductible. The platform fee is $905/month for enrolled employees, with the flexibility for employees to choose different plan levels. The ICHRA is pre-tax for both employer and employee, with HSA-eligible plans available for high-income or healthy employees.\n\n- Current vs. Proposed Coverage: The current coverage is a Kaiser silver plan with a $2,750 deductible, with 7 of 19 employees enrolled. The proposed coverage through Thatch offers individual marketplace plans with comparable or better coverage and multiple carrier options.\n\n2. Identification of Stakeholders:\n\n- Prospect Company (Salvado Law Offices):\n  - Alberto Salvado: Owner and decision-maker, approved moving forward with ICHRA.\n  - Carlos Salvado: Employee with dependent coverage.\n  - Tolar: Handles finances and payroll questions.\n  - CPA/Accountant: Manages payroll taxes through QuickBooks.\n\n- Broker Team (Liberty Run Benefits):\n  - Greg Woolley: Primary broker contact, responsible for operational questions and account management.\n  - Lexi Davis: Manages account administration and data requests.\n  - Judy: Works with the client and previously sent census information.\n  - Benefit Counselors: Scheduled for on-site enrollment assistance.\n\n- Thatch (ICHRA Platform Provider):\n  - Kameron Schmidt: Thatch representative responsible for platform setup, compliance, and ongoing support.\n\n- Employees: Total of 19 employees, with 7 currently enrolled in the company plan.\n\n3. Important Milestones and Timestamps:\n\n- December 8, 2025: Initial quote review and financial analysis presented.\n- December 16, 2025: Alberto approved moving forward with ICHRA during the meeting.\n- January 1, 2026: Deadline for completing business information forms and providing required data/documentation.\n- Week of January 12, 2026: Scheduled on-site enrollment assistance by benefit counselors.\n\n4.

For Salvado Law, they use QuickBooks for payroll administration, with Alberto submitting hours and his CPA handling taxes. Alberto manually enters payroll information including hours, bonuses, and benefit deductions into QuickBooks on a weekly basis. For benefits administration, they rely on a broker service provided by Greg Woolley's team, which includes Judy and Lexi Davis who handle data management and behind-the-scenes account administration. Currently, the company offers Kaiser health insurance and manages employee enrollment through this broker relationship. There is no mention of using a dedicated benefits administration platform like Ease, Rippling, or Zenefits. The workflow appears to be manual, with Alberto handling payroll entries and deductions while the broker team manages enrollment data and carrier communications.\n\nFor All Valley Heating & Air, they also rely on a broker (Colonial Life) for benefits administration. The administration involves specific PEPM fees and a flat monthly admin fee, with the broker assisting in employee enrollment and managing the ICHRA setup. This indicates a reliance on broker services rather than a dedicated benefits administration platform. \n\nOverall, both companies manage benefits through broker relationships and manual processes, without the use of a dedicated benefits administration platform."

            "transcript": "Greg Woolley:\nOne thing to stress when we're looking at the dollars is that that's for all the employees, whereas, I mean, they don't have all those employees enrolled currently. \nKameron Schmidt:\nRight, right. \nGreg Woolley:\nSo, and even based on what I'm seeing here, there, I'm showing that there's 2, 4, 6 7 actually on the sheet that Judy sent over, which still is 5,400, which is basically, and you've got them at 5,900 with every employee enrolled. So obviously there's cost savings there. Yeah. \nKameron Schmidt:\nSo this is, yeah, of course. This is based on 2025 numbers. So this isn't even with their 2020, their 2026 renewal numbers aren't in here. Gotcha. And so that's even, yeah, so if you look at, so in 2025 we have their current spend at 4,800. Right. \nGreg Woolley:\nAnd next year they're at 54. Exactly, exactly. \nKameron Schmidt:\nYeah. \nGreg Woolley:\nSo, Which is a 13% increase. Right. \nKameron Schmidt:\nAnd so this is, but the 3,800 here, this is 2026 for thatch. So if we take the 54 minus the, they're saving about 1,561 $60 per month on. Gotcha. \nGreg Woolley:\nYeah. \nKameron Schmidt:\nAnd I'll make sure to illustrate that. Yeah. \nGreg Woolley:\nAnd then also I noticed as far as, you've got two people on there where allowances unaffordable, right. It's showing. And how does that work then? Yeah. \nKameron Schmidt:\nSo again, affordability doesn't necessarily matter for this group because they're not over 50. Gotcha. Yeah. But technically the way that affordability works is the employee must be able to purchase the lowest cost silver plan without paying more than 9.9% of their in. Gotcha. Yeah. \nGreg Woolley:\nBut it has no impact on this size group. Right. \nKameron Schmidt:\nExactly. Okay. \nGreg Woolley:\nYep, yep. And Lexi, Good morning. \nLexi Davis:\nGood morning. \nGreg Woolley:\nHow are you? \nLexi Davis:\nGood, How are you? \nGreg Woolley:\nGood Morning guys. \nKameron Schmidt:\nAnybody else joining us this morning? \nGreg Woolley:\nAlberto, how are you sir? \nAlberto Salvado:\nI'm good, Greg. How are you? \nGreg Woolley:\nI'm doing just fine. And we have Cameron who is with the icra, who was gonna explain the ICRA to us on the phone with us on the line. And then Lexi Davis, who, it's actually Judy's daughter who is the one who really manages a lot of our behind the scenes items for your, for your account. \nLexi Davis:\nGood morning, Alberto. Good Morning. \nGreg Woolley:\nSo what I want to do is briefly have, have Cameron kind of explain what the icra account is and how that works. One of the key things is that it's gonna give your employees a lot of flexibility, meaning basically they're gonna be able pretty much pick any plan they choose to Okay. From carrier to plan type. But we'll also explain as far as how it has a positive in impact for you from a, from a cashflow standpoint too, for the, for the organization. But I know the nice thing is that you may have an employer or two who may wanna keep Kaiser. They could still do that if they chose to, or you have others who wanna to go to CareFirst, et cetera. And I'll let Cameron kind of go through the information presentation and then we can kind of talk more after that. So Cameron, feel free to take it away. Awesome. \nKameron Schmidt:\nThanks Greg. Alberta, nice to meet you. Likewise. Thanks. So, yeah, so that, and in general, icra, so IRA stands for individual coverage health reimbursement arrangement. So what that is is really just a, a fixed contribution model. So to put it really simply, with Satch, you'll just set an allowance of what you wanna spend per employee each month on their insurance. You give that money to the the employee, we actually help allocate that to them. And then they can, like he said, go spend that money on the insurance that they want. These contributions are both pre-tax for you as the employer and the employee as well. And so what this fixed contribution model does exactly what Greg was saying. And number one for the employer gives you predictability and control over your spending each year because ultimately you're setting the budget. And then number two, it gives your employees complete freedom of choice when it comes to selecting the plan, the carrier, things like that, that meet their needs the most in terms of administrating it, thatch administers all of that for you. So in terms of the employees are gonna now go from maybe like, I believe you guys all have Kaiser, they're gonna go from only having Kaiser to having a ton of plan options in their area. So Thatch helps support them in making sure that they don't feel overwhelmed in that decision making process. So we can help them actually select the plans. We do open enrollments for them, et cetera. So we help with that. And then we do all the deductions automatically through payroll. So you're not having to keep track of receipts or anything like that. And we manage all the compliance for you as well. So ultimately, from your standpoint as the employer, all you need to worry about is what is my budget that I'm setting for my employees each month. Everything else that handles on the back end for you. Any questions on that model or Greg, anything else you want me to touch on there? \nGreg Woolley:\nNot on there. I, I think basically if you want to, to kind of show examples on the, on the program and, and the rates and Yeah. And all and kind of dig in a little more. I think Alberta may have some questions once we get there. Sure. \nKameron Schmidt:\nA hundred percent. So yeah, what we did here was I put in all of your guys' census information for 2025. I actually don't have the 2026 renewal in here. So you'll see the 2025 numbers. And what I've done here is set what it's called as a benchmark for your guys' current plan offering. So essentially what I wanted to do was mirror, okay, if, if this group did the exact same thing in terms of plan coverage on thatch, would that save them money, would it cost them more money, et cetera. So that's what we have, we're looking at here. And like I said, it's for 2025. So what I'll do is just share my screen and then we'll just kind of open the floors for questions. Okay. Cool. So guys, the first thing that I want to do here is I want to point our direction over to this benchmark. And that's what I was kind of getting at. So what I did was I took that Kaiser plan that the majority or that the entire group was on, and we've stacked ranked it based on the other plans in the area. And so we usually start at the first percentile silver plan. And what that essentially means is it is the first percentile, which actually is gonna be the lowest premium silver plan. So it's the most middle plan in the, in the area for all of your employees. And then for 2025, you guys were covering 50% of all premiums for the employee. And that's how I have it set here as well. So you're gonna be still covering 50% of the premiums. So then I'm gonna bounce us on over here to this nu or this box with all the numbers. So this first number, the employee contribution, I always like to point out where it is showing less. We actually, and that's great, we want it to show less. We actually don't know if it's gonna be less or more. And the reason that we don't know is because the, on the IRA model, the employee does have the opportunity to buy up if they want. They could go buy a platinum plan, they could buy a gold plan if they want. They could buy down, they could buy a bronze plan if they want. So there could even be more savings for the employee if they want. It's completely their choice. \nGreg Woolley:\nThe key, the key there, Alberto, is your contribution is, is set as far as you'll set the dollar amount based on that silver plan. Or if you chose to, you could adjust it. You know, if you want to have it a little bit more, you can do that as well. Correct. The employee costs will vary based on the plan they choose. The other thing I just, and I know Cameron's gonna mention this, but this is showing cost if all your employees were enrolled, which we know is not the case. That is correct. \nKameron Schmidt:\nYep. This is absolutely, if all nine, if all 19 employees that were listed on the census enrolled, this is what your cost would be. Okay. So as I was saying, in terms of the employee contribution, we don't really know that could be higher or lower with the employer contribution. However, we do know for sure what yours will be because it's a set contribution. So right here where you see 4,800 or almost $4,900, this was your total monthly spend in 2025 for insurance in 2026, your total monthly spend is going to 54 21 right here. \nGreg Woolley:\nAnd that's based on your Kaiser renewal? Yeah, Kaiser renewal, Yeah. \nKameron Schmidt:\nOkay. Right here, the 38 61, that is based on 2026 plans in thatch. So the individual marketplace plans on thatch then, plus the 9 0 5 would be the platform fees. That's just for us administering the plans, advisory fee fees, et cetera. Again, that's assuming all 19 employees enrolled. Your total cost, if every single person enrolled would come to $4,766 and 50 cents per month. So a total savings of, based on the 2026 renewal, 6, 650 $5 per month. \nAlberto Salvado:\nAnd that's if all 19 were to Yep. \nKameron Schmidt:\nThat's if all 19 were to enroll. Yep. As you can see here, I'll just, I'll click here. Let's say hypothetically you didn't enroll and let's say she didn't enroll and Carlos didn't enroll, you see the, those costs go down. Okay. And that's another thing I want to point out. Actually, you see this 9 0 5 number, you're only charged for the people that do enroll. So again, hypothetically, if you don't enroll, there goes that fee. So the less people enroll, the less fees as well. Gotcha. \nAlberto Salvado:\nSo basically I could offer the silver plan half premiums for the silver plan and if they wanna buy up, they can, or if they wanna go down, they can. Okay. Exactly. \nKameron Schmidt:\nYep. So just using like yourself as an example, and we'll take a look into the plans now. 'cause I know again, I, I think you had some employees that maybe were wanting to get off of Kaiser. So now for example, in your area there's gonna be CareFirst, blue Cross Kaiser and UnitedHealthcare. There's gonna be HMOs and PPOs available. You're gonna have 43 plans to choose from. So we can click in here. And so yeah, your employees would have the option to, they could buy again, they could buy any plan they want. They can get the most basic silver plan at 50%. Or they could say, you know what, I want to go up a little bit and I want to get the gold plan so they could pay a little extra for the gold plan, like using you as an example, you could, you, your contribution for your medical plan, again, based on the census I received, you were paying $310 out of your own pocket each month. So you could get a gold plan for $4 less with this model. \nGreg Woolley:\nIt also gives, it also gives the option, which might be something of interest to you or some of the higher income people as to HSAs. Yep. Access where some of your employees may not care for those and you may or may not have interest in something like that. So it gives you that flexibility as well. \nKameron Schmidt:\nA hundred percent. \nAlberto Salvado:\nYeah. Not too familiar with HSAs, but what health savings account? \nGreg Woolley:\nYeah, basically it's, I, I was related as think of it as like a 401k for your health insurance, but it, you own the money like your 401k and you can actually invest it once you put money in there and it's, you know, it's a tax free benefit too. So usually people who have interest would be people who are fairly healthy but also have income that they'd rather not pay, be paying taxes on. Gotcha. \nAlberto Salvado:\nBut yeah. So if I, go ahead, go ahead. So since you guys are basically would be handling the platform on that, you would get the updates and tell me how much I have to take out of the, the paycheck? Or is that, you know, for them? For the employee, employee contribution. \nKameron Schmidt:\nYeah. And who's your payroll provider, if you don't mind me asking? \nAlberto Salvado:\nQuickBooks? We do it through QuickBook. I do it through my CPA. Amazing. \nKameron Schmidt:\nYeah, so we actually have a full integration with QuickBooks. So the way that it works is actually we pay the carrier on the 15th the entire amount of the premiums and then we just sync with pay QuickBooks for anyone that went over their amount and is like the, the $200 we just sync with their payroll or your with QuickBooks to pull that additional, those additional funds. Okay. So yeah, you won't have to like worry about a file. Like we don't send you a file, well we will send you a file at the end of each month, like reconciling everything, like letting you know your ins and outs. But in terms of nobody's putting down a card or any extra payment information or anything like that. Yeah. Okay. \nAlberto Salvado:\nCool. Awesome. \nGreg Woolley:\nYeah, the the, the other thing, Alberta, what we'll do, especially this first year and, and Cameron, and I'll talk a little bit more about it if you decide to move forward with this, is I'll have our local benefit counselors visit your offices to assist them as far as with the platform. So, and then they'll still be able to enroll in any of the voluntary and the dental and those type of programs as well. So especially the first year through, there'll be a lot of questions, most likely Sure. \nAlberto Salvado:\nFor anybody. \nGreg Woolley:\nSo we wanna make sure we give you the, that service level and you know, we would be out there multiple days and take a little bit more time with employees. We can also do it virtually as well for with our people involved. \nAlberto Salvado:\nExcellent, Love that. \nKameron Schmidt:\nAnd like I was telling, telling Greg I can be as hands-on or hands-off as you need me to be as well. So in terms of if I need to do any kind of educational resources on what an ICRA is and what that is, I'm more than happy to provide Greg those resources or step in. So whatever you guys need from me. \nAlberto Salvado:\nBut, So just to, yeah, just to reiterate, so right now the way I have it set up with Kaiser, I guess Kaiser, I have like a silver plan with them if I remember correctly. Correct? Yep. So the baseline would be the silver plan, you know, option on this and yeah, I get it. Yep. \nKameron Schmidt:\nA hundred percent. And again, hypothetically, if you were like, well hey there's enough savings here where I could up my offering, you could technically, you could move it up and say, Hey, I want my baseline to be a first percentile gold plan and then this is what the cost would be for there. \nGreg Woolley:\nAnd so, okay, you would essentially be covering 50% of gold plans And Cameron, with the silver plan, again, I think you're using the base of the silver plan, right? You could also, Alberto, we can adjust the contribution so it fits kind of similar to where your plan is currently as the basis and then in future years you're can adjust that as well. Up or down. Yeah. So that way you know, your dollars there. So that's the only thing, which again, I just always like to make sure, I wanna make sure that it's not, you know, it's good for you obviously, but it's also that it's good for the employee because you're the one who's going to get the feedback, you know, so we wanna make sure, so we can take a look at, can you take Cameron show an example of similar Yeah, similar plan. \nKameron Schmidt:\nSo let's just for easy, we'll just use Alberto here. The similar plan is gonna be, again, your guys' deductible right now for the individual is 27 50. So we try to go find that. So you're looking at more of like the 50 percentile silver, you can get $0 deductible here. Yeah. \nGreg Woolley:\nSo more $2,500 deductible versus, versus 4,000 right now. \nKameron Schmidt:\nYeah, so well I will say again, from the numbers that I've got, the, yeah, the Kaiser plan that you guys have right now, the deductible is 27 50. Okay. \nGreg Woolley:\nYeah. \nKameron Schmidt:\nSo we would try to emulate that as much as possible. So yeah, you're looking at probably the 50th percentile silver plan would be the same. \nAlberto Salvado:\nAnd you, you already mentioned this, but there, I know a lot of, a lot of my employees are asking for PPO there, there are plenty of PPO options. Yeah. \nKameron Schmidt:\nYeah. So again, in Maryland, plenty of PPOs. Let's see, Virginia, yeah, EPOH, M-O-P-O-S-P-P-O. \nGreg Woolley:\nAnd, and that's the thing too, Alberto, where having that communication with the employees, because everyone says I want a PPO on a PPO, but if they can save, really they want is flexibility to go outside of Kaiser. And there are a lot of POS plans, which are similar to PPO. There are even HMO plans that if, you know, if they're going to see, you know, Dr. Jones down the street and he's in that HMO plan, they can choose to do that as well. Again, HMOs aren't like the old school where, you know, there are some with referrals, but most of them act like a PPO where you don't necessarily need to be going referral for everything ahead of time, you know, where you're bouncing around. Gotcha. \nAlberto Salvado:\nYep. So just so I can just get a a, can we uncheck to the amount of people that actually have currently, just so I can see the difference that way? \nKameron Schmidt:\nYeah, so I, I I will say, guys, this is based on the census and Greg, unless I'm, there's an updated census I'm missing, this is based on the enrollment for 2025. Yeah. \nGreg Woolley:\nThe, the, what Judy sent over to you was the entire census of the company. So what I have here as far as enrolled, I'm showing if you wanna, Alberta, I'm not showing you on the list that, that Judy sent over to me. Is that accurate or are you enrolled? \nAlberto Salvado:\nThat, that's accurate. I, I go through my wife. \nGreg Woolley:\nShe's Awesome. That, that's what I thought. So the fir the first one that's gonna be on there is gonna uncheck all the way down to Aaron Bales. Aaron Bales will be the first one that I see. \nAlberto Salvado:\nWell, my brother should be on there unless I miss that. \nGreg Woolley:\nCarlos. \nAlberto Salvado:\nCarlos, okay. \nGreg Woolley:\nAnd you know, you, you're right, he is there. He, she's got him in a different order. I've got Matt, Madeline Bell. Yes. \nKameron Schmidt:\nAngela or not Enrolled. \nGreg Woolley:\nEnrolled. Okay. I'm just gonna give you the names of people who are enrolled. Okay. Maureen Fa, fallow or Falo? \nAlberto Salvado:\nYeah, she's in there. \nGreg Woolley:\nSamantha Hall. \nAlberto Salvado:\nOkay, So Kimberly, so no, lemme see. No, no. Kimberly Kimberly's not. Okay. \nGreg Woolley:\nActually I was show, I was showing Kimberly on ours actually. \nAlberto Salvado:\nOh, She, maybe she, did she sign on? \nGreg Woolley:\nYeah, so basically we need Done, okay, Uncheck Martin Rodriguez. Okay. Matthew hand, Ricardo, no, Ricardo's on and Polaris on Rolando is not on leave. Samantha Hall, Sandra Gomez is not. Sebastian I don't believe is He's not, Sweeney is not. And I don't think that last person is either. She is not. I'm sh I'm showing a total 2, 4, 6 7 enrolled currently. \nKameron Schmidt:\n1, 2, 3. \nAlberto Salvado:\nOh yeah, that's, yep. Yeah, that's substantially lower. Yeah. Yeah. \nKameron Schmidt:\nOkay. \nGreg Woolley:\nSo again, now the other thing is you may have employees because of flexibility, Choose To enroll, but you know, potentially there's tremendous savings for you. But at the same time, again, you, you know, that contribution that that, that 50%, you can leave it there, we can make sure that it matches up to a comparable plan that you currently have in regards to benefits. \nKameron Schmidt:\nYeah, I would say, I would say the compar, I would, I'll save this and send this again to Greg, but I think we, a good place to start would be the 50th percentile and you guys can play with it from there. Yeah, Gotcha. Oh, and then it, oh man, I just did every, oh, we'll have to, yeah, if you could, Greg, if you wanna email me just who's currently enrolled Sure. I'll put together a new quote with just the people that are enrolled so we can see that as well. Okay. \nGreg Woolley:\nYeah. And to give you an idea, Alberto, and see we, we already know Kaiser is the renewal, which was sent over was 5,400. The CareFirst programs range, you know, I've got a 5,900 to 6800, 6200, I've got a 7,000 from UnitedHealthcare. I've got, I do have United UnitedHealthcare plan, but there's funding involved, you know, as far as there are lower, there are a couple lower cost options, but those plants are things that you would never select. Do you know what I mean? Right. So this here, I think because of the, the clamoring for flexibility with your employees, I think they'll be really happy with this. Gotcha. The, the timing on this though, just so you know, especially when we're, you know, think of it, even if we're just changing a, a group carrier, there's, we have a, there's a little more lead time that we, that's required for Cameron to get this set up. So there's paperwork and all from his side that he's gonna need to get information from you, you know, if you decide to move forward with this, probably want to get this to him before the first of the year, some of the information at least. And that way we can, you know, we don't have the flexibility, but it's in the individual plans basically, you know, if we don't have the flexibility to enroll people late and move them back to the first of the month, you know, so we wanna make sure we're on the front, front end of things. So we've got some workarounds for some things, but we need to really kind of, especially this first time through, make sure that we've got everybody enrolled who needs to be enrolled and do that, you know, in, you know, early to mid-January versus go until the, you know, the 30th of the month. \nAlberto Salvado:\nCan I, I know follow's trying to get her kids on because I guess her husband has taken 'em off. They, the divorce, her husband has taken off the gotcha insurance. So she's, she's in a little bit of a pinch, but during that, because I guess we have Kaiser through the 15th of February, or You, you have Kaiser through the 1st of February. \nGreg Woolley:\nNow if, if her children are losing their coverage already, we can, she can add them to Kaiser for, for the month. Okay. She has 30 days from the time they, she, they lose their coverage. So she's welcome to reach out to me if, if, if that's a situation. And quite honestly, the other thing from that, I mean there's, there are Cobra options which she would have up to 60 days to take care of so she could kind of float it as well because she can go backwards. So, you know, if she's got coverage through January 1st and she's worried about that first month there, yes, she can go add them to it or she could let it ride that month and god forbid something happens, she could join Cobra back to the first. Okay. \nAlberto Salvado:\nYeah, because I, I know her kid's going through some PT for a messed up me. Okay. \nGreg Woolley:\nYeah, so she would definitely wanna, if, if she's lost coverage, she was about to lose coverage, we can get her onto the Kaiser plan for that month if, if she needs to or wants to. Okay. \nAlberto Salvado:\nOkay. All right, cool. So, so if we get everything, if I get everything to you by the first, when do you think the lift off is for this? Yeah. \nGreg Woolley:\nOh sorry, go ahead Greg. \nKameron Schmidt:\nGo ahead. No, go ahead Cameron from your side, what, what it is From my standpoint, once I get the green light, really just a 24 hour turnaround for me so we could get the invites out. Long story short, you tell me green light, I get your account set up, I get your order form ready to go 24 hours later, you can send out the invite. So yeah, we could get everyone in if, if we know by early January we could get everyone enrolled within two weeks of January. \nGreg Woolley:\nSo Yeah, And I would say we probably would have benefit counselors out there the week of the 12th. Perfect. \nKameron Schmidt:\nOkay. \nAlberto Salvado:\nYep. \nGreg Woolley:\nSo, and then we can be out there, you know, multiple days and again, we can also do phone and they do have the ability to do some of this on their own as far as the portal itself. But again, this first year I'd recommend that we kind of have our benefit counselors out there and kind of reviewing with them and matching up their voluntary benefits as well. Okay. \nKameron Schmidt:\nAnd I don't, sorry to get off topic and I don't wanna overcomplicate anything, but you're, you guys are currently not covering dependents right now, correct? Is that, is that correct? \nAlberto Salvado:\nOkay. \nKameron Schmidt:\nThe only one that's, and the only one I have listed on the census of having dependents is Carlos. That's correct. \nAlberto Salvado:\nOkay. He, yeah, and he pays for that. I just take out more from his check for that. Okay. \nKameron Schmidt:\nOkay, cool. I just wanted to make sure that you felt like com, it sounded like he's your brother so I wanna make sure you felt comfortable in his coverage as well, so Yeah, yeah. Cool. \nAlberto Salvado:\nIt might be, there used to be somebody else with dependents on it, but I think she left or she went with her husband, so I just can't remember. \nKameron Schmidt:\nOkay. \nGreg Woolley:\nAnd so really what we'll do is Cameron's gonna rework that proposal a little bit with making sure the plans match up, but in the meantime he will also send over some information to you, the quote unquote paperwork that you're gonna need to complete and give you a list of things such as the, you know, all, all the census information. The other thing I wanted to just double check with with Cameron is you said you do your payroll through your accountant, is it, Or? \nAlberto Salvado:\nYeah, she does it all. So I'm, so, I mean I'm able to, I have access to the payroll, so I actually submit the hours because I, you know, I, I have to, some people check in or clock in, right? So once I do that, I just send, send, but my CPA does all the taxes so I could actually manually up up Right. \nGreg Woolley:\nAnd say, and that might be, that might be something that first time through, depending what the process is before trying to do feeds and all. Because again, I know, and Cameron, you correct me if I'm wrong, a lot of times with with sometimes you've got smaller vendors or payroll companies, sometimes it's just as easy for them to enter it, but at least initially and then we can get it set up on auto feed. So yeah, if someone gets terminated it will feed back as well. Okay. \nAlberto Salvado:\nExactly. Yeah, I mean the only thing I really need on for QuickBooks is just to make sure I put in the correct numbers and the correct categories. And once I do that I, I have to do payroll every weekend anyhow, so with the hours it's no big deals and bonuses, so Cool. Gotcha. \nGreg Woolley:\nYep. \nKameron Schmidt:\nWhatever's easiest for you guys, we can set up and facilitate, so. Okay, cool. \nGreg Woolley:\nAnything else, Alberto that from your side? Nope. \nAlberto Salvado:\nOkay, so, so feel free. So Greg just, and I didn't tell you this before, but so Tolar involved you, she can answer any questions but just any finances or payroll from everybody else. Yeah, just keep it to accounts. \nGreg Woolley:\nSo Yeah, and what we can also do is that first, that second week of January, we could actually do a webinar cool as well to answer some questions. We, we do that in person as well, but it might be, you know, kind of give them a little bit of a heads up saying, Hey, this is what we're doing, you're gonna have a lot of options. We don't need to go into all the detail specifics in regards to cost necessarily, but hey, this is how it's gonna work for you. You're gonna give you a lot more flexibility. You can pick, you know, less, less lower cost plan. You can pick a plan where you feel you need more coverage, you can do that as well. Gotcha. \nAlberto Salvado:\nBecause the income of each individual doesn't matter as far as their quote, it's gonna be the same age is the only thing that determines the amount, Right. \nKameron Schmidt:\nAge and location. Yep, yep. \nGreg Woolley:\nYeah, Maryland V that's the thing. Maryland versus Virginia does matter and that's gonna be based on their resident state. So we're whatever where, and you don't have anybody in DC from what I recall either. \nAlberto Salvado:\nNot anymore. Yeah. Right. We had years ago we did, but we don't have any now. \nGreg Woolley:\nYeah. So, and this is nice, even if you have end up for some reason, you end up with a, maybe someone who's working in Pennsylvania, maybe you've got a remote employee for some reason or something like that, you know, you can even, that's not a problem at all. So, yep, Yep. \nKameron Schmidt:\nPerfect. \nAlberto Salvado:\nExcellent. Well I'm, I'm fine with it if you wanna, I'll give it a go Sound sounds good. \nGreg Woolley:\nWe will, we'll get that process started for you and either Lexi, Cameron, myself will be communicating to you. Gotcha. \nKameron Schmidt:\nEd, real, real quick, just while I've got you then I can get everything started. Are we comfortable, do you wanna do the 50th percentile or do you want to do the first percentile? \nAlberto Salvado:\nSo when you say 50th and that, I guess maybe that Yeah, I should ask this question 50th. Yeah, 50th of first to first. What do you mean by that? \nKameron Schmidt:\nYeah, so 50th percentile is just gonna be a, it's stacked ranked by premium. So first percentile is gonna be the lowest premium plan. Okay. 50th percentile is gonna be the 50th ranked premium plan. Okay. Based on your guys' current coverage, you guys are on a 50th percentile silver plan. Yeah, that's fine. \nAlberto Salvado:\nKeep it the same. Okay. \nKameron Schmidt:\nOkay. Okay, cool. \nAlberto Salvado:\nYeah, Very good. \nKameron Schmidt:\nAlright guys, I'll get started on that then and then Thank you Cam. Yeah, no problem guys. \nGreg Woolley:\nThank You Alberto. Yep. \nAlberto Salvado:\nYou guys have any questions, lemme know And Greg Lauren's gonna reach out to you because she's, she's in a bind with that so you can look out Yeah, have her, Have her have her give me a call and Okay. \nGreg Woolley:\nI'll let her, I'll, I'll give her the general details of what we're doing, again, without any costs or anything like that. \nAlberto Salvado:\nAlso I, The cost of what it, I don't mind the cost just to, just to each employee payroll. Yeah. So, yeah. Gotcha. \nGreg Woolley:\nCool. Okay, very good. And Cameron, you have the opportunity to stay on for a minute. If you could, I'd appreciate it. So I'm thank you all. I didn't hear you was all if, If you can on for a minute just make sure we've got our stuff going. \nAlberto Salvado:\nOh, you want me to stay on or somebody else? No, no. \nGreg Woolley:\nCameron. Cameron not you. You can head out Albert or I know you got a busy day, probably Take it easy. \nAlberto Salvado:\nYeah, I'm in court right now. I kind of picked up a case last night. Okay. Take Bye. \nGreg Woolley:\nThank you all. \nLexi Davis:\nYep, thanks Lexi. \nGreg Woolley:\nOkay, I just want to kind of make sure, yeah, and again, I know you've worked with Judy before, I think you've, you may have worked with Lexi as well, I'm not sure, just make sure they're included in everything that goes out. Yep. They're gonna be the ones when you need data and stuff or whatever, they're gonna be the ones who are probably gonna be able to give it to you and give it to you quicker. Okay. \nKameron Schmidt:\nOkay. \nGreg Woolley:\nI will be the one asking, I will be probably more of a operational, like, okay, how do we handle X, Y and Z type thing. Sure. And I just wanted to, you know, we talked to, no, I wanna make sure we have the enrollers involved, not so much from the enrollment of the plans necessarily, but just to protect our voluntary benefits because Yeah. You know, outta sight outta mind, they're not gonna even worry about that stuff then. Yeah. Because this is a good thing for him, you know, it's gonna generate some savings for him with the company, but we also wanna make sure that we're just particular our other business with him, which, and also protects the employees really. So, Yeah. \nKameron Schmidt:\nSo I just wanna make sure I'm understanding you. Like basically you're just asking like make sure that it's only medical being offered, turn off the simple and vision. Yes. Okay. \nGreg Woolley:\nYeah, No worries. Now again, the, I realize that child dentals right, right. Prior those things, the requirements obviously. Yeah. But we don't want any, any additional Yeah. \nKameron Schmidt:\nVoluntary there. \nGreg Woolley:\nYeah. And the, the the, yeah, let's do, let's do it like that for now. If we needed to turn vision on, we could, I would assume. \nKameron Schmidt:\nYeah, obviously we just need to know, I would like to know before anyone has enrolled. \nGreg Woolley:\nYeah, un understood. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think we, I don't think we need to worry about that because the, the question also with that is does that adjust the fees at all? \nKameron Schmidt:\nNo, no, doesn't, doesn't adjust anything. Yeah. Okay. \nGreg Woolley:\nYeah. \nKameron Schmidt:\nOkay. \nGreg Woolley:\nAnd that's with the dental as well. It doesn't adjust the fees. Correct. \nKameron Schmidt:\nYeah. \nGreg Woolley:\nSo, right. We would wanna keep them separate. Yeah. \nKameron Schmidt:\nYeah. Again, the only reason any any employer ever offers it is just like a Convenience. \nGreg Woolley:\nYeah. It's exactly. \nKameron Schmidt:\nYeah. Okay. \nGreg Woolley:\nYep. \nKameron Schmidt:\nVery good. \nGreg Woolley:\nAnd I think Okay, good enough as so you'll send out information. \nKameron Schmidt:\nYeah, I mean honestly, yeah, I'll re I'll reply to everybody. I'll just need some basic business information from Alberto and then I can get everything started. It's pretty, pretty quick setup. And then in terms of, gosh, oh yeah, if you, do you still want that quote?

I mean we've, we have groups all the way up to a thousand employees, so just, I like, sometimes it, it just, it, it all, it all just depends on, honestly, it just depends on the geographics of the employee, of the employer and the premiums and the plans in the area.

Key Points Discussed\n\n   - Employer's Interest & Requirements:\n     - Primary Driver: Managing significant renewal increase (50% renewal mentioned as impetus for exploring ICHRA).\n     - Critical Constraint: Employer is NOT willing to downgrade plan quality. Specifically stated they will not move to standard Gold plans; they want to maintain current coverage levels.\n     - Coverage Preference: Interested in Platinum or high-tier Gold plans (Gold 100 or \"Gold Plus\") to match current benefits.\n     - Employee Demographics: Significant Spanish-speaking population requiring dedicated support.\n     - Spanish Support Requirement: One-on-one consultative support in Spanish is essential for implementation success.\n\n   - Cost Analysis & Feasibility:\n     - Current Monthly Premium: $203,000 (approximately $2.436M annually).\n     - Initial Quote Discrepancy: Thatch quote showed $192,000 monthly - $11,000/month ($132k annually) below actual.\n     - Gold 100 Benchmark: Would result in approximately $5M+ annual total spend (significant increase even with 50% renewal).\n     - Preliminary Assessment: Cost analysis suggests ICHRA may not be financially viable for this client given their coverage requirements.\n     - Quote Methodology: Thatch used new \"flat cost share\" contribution strategy for this quote.\n\n   - Technical Discussion Points:\n     - Confusion around \"total monthly cost\" vs. \"total premium cost\" in quote structure.\n     - Need for clearer gross premium comparisons (employer + employee contributions combined).\n     - Request for plan design details to help client understand coverage comparisons across rating areas.\n     - Discussion of Platinum plan benchmarking challenges (not available in all rating areas, requires custom \"and/or\" structure).\n\n2. Stakeholders Identified\n\n   - Broker Team (Newfront):\n     - Paul Martinez\n       - Role: Executive Vice President\n       - Responsibilities: Leading this evaluation personally due to late timing and team capacity during open enrollment; has 18-person support team; 20 years industry experience.\n       - Location: Mill Valley, California (Marin County).\n       - Experience: Has implemented ICHRA before with other clients; currently has groups on ICHRA.\n\n     - Ashley Bielicki\n       - Role: Team member supporting Paul Martinez\n       - Responsibilities: Day-to-day quote management and service support.\n       - Location: Phoenix, Arizona.\n\n   - Vendor Team (Thatch):\n     - Tom Hemmingsen\n       - Role: Sales Representative, dedicated Newfront contact for mid-market/larger clients.\n       - Responsibilities: Quote development, demos, evaluation support through implementation handoff.\n       - Tenure: Nearly 3 years at Thatch, 10th employee, first go-to-market hire.\n       - Location: Oakland Hills, Montclair (San Francisco Bay Area).\n\n     - Jesse Hernandez\n       - Role: Account Executive/Relationship Manager\n       - Responsibilities: Newfront relationship management, opportunity coordination.\n\n   - Client:\n     - Ty Warner (Employer Group)\n       - Location: Santa Barbara area (California).\n       - Employee Base:"

That would be their effective date? \nAlia Gurtov:\nYeah, if you want them to have, or what do you want them to? Sorry, you want to. You said you wanted them to have effective coverage on one one? Yes, so, um, I'm not going to. \nCandiceCruz:\nWhat would their higher date be? Uh, don't we have a hold of 30 days? \nAlia Gurtov:\nThat's up to you, That's, uh, that's not something we enforce. \nCandiceCruz:\nOkay, so how would I do? How can you walk me through? Pretend you're adding somebody? \nAlia Gurtov:\nUh, yes, so you would go add employee. And if you want, you can send me the spreadsheet of everybody and I can upload them now. \nCandiceCruz:\nOh, OK. But some of them are part time, so they might not be eligible. So, and then I just invite them. \nAlia Gurtov:\nExactly. So I will add them. And if you indicate on the spreadsheet where I show you to say part time versus full time, then you'll be able to just go like. \nCandiceCruz:\nYeah, I've been doing that. \nAlia Gurtov:\nOK, perfect. \nCandiceCruz:\nIt's been going really well. Oh, good. Here's the thing is that I just wanted to see. So we want them to officially have coverage. \nAlia Gurtov:\nOne one, awesome them. \nCandiceCruz:\nThe expectation is for them to enroll in the next two weeks and for us to enroll them, and for them to have coverage as a one one, whatever plan they choose. \nAlia Gurtov:\nUm, so we can do that because they'll be in a special enrollment period because they're being offered the Icra for the first time. Um, I won't actually invite Nicole, I'm just going to show you we won't. I won't like, click all the way through, but just to show you what you'll see. Once I add them to the dashboard, you know, you'll do your invite selected. And you can see that we're we're enforcing a 1229 end date. So they'll have from whatever date you invite them to. \nCandiceCruz:\nOK, here's the thing is, I can invite them to their personal email, right? \nAlia Gurtov:\nYes. \nCandiceCruz:\nOK, so what are you going to need from me? \nAlia Gurtov:\nLet me email you. Actually, I'm doing it right now. \nCandiceCruz:\nSo right now I have a spreadsheet. I have employee name, title. You don't need the title, right? \nAlia Gurtov:\nI don't. Here, I can show you very, here, I'll stop sharing and I'll show you exactly the data that we want. It's the same, it's the same upload that we did last time. \nCandiceCruz:\nYou don't need their rate. You just need to know their hourly or salary. Exactly. \nAlia Gurtov:\nYeah, it's these fields here. So first name, last name. Personal email or work email? Start date Full-time I can't. \nCandiceCruz:\nThe start date is going to be their inherited start date. That's okay, that's okay. \nAlia Gurtov:\nyeah, it's any, any start date, it's fine. As long as it's not after one one, then they wouldn't be eligible for coverage on one one, but as long as it's prior to one one. \nCandiceCruz:\nOkay, what if it's? if it's like 10 years ago, that'll be okay, okay, okay. Do you need their phone numbers? \nAlia Gurtov:\nA phone number would be great. Okay. \nCandiceCruz:\nSome of them I do have them, and some of them I don't. So this is what I have. Employee name, effective date, entity, which is MSO. You don't need to know that because they're all MSO. Yeah. \nAlia Gurtov:\nAnd we do need, if you can do it, it's better to have first name and then last name, because otherwise I got to separate them out. But I don't know if they pull it that way. \nCandiceCruz:\nIt's only 18, but I'll separate them. No problem. Awesome. \nAlia Gurtov:\nThank you. So yeah, one of their emails, start date, employment type. Pay type, salary, or hourly. Native employee ID, which is like those two digits I think most employees have. Maybe they're three digits, sometimes. I don't know if you've got that. \nCandiceCruz:\nHow do I know? I don't even know what that is. \nAlia Gurtov:\nOkay. We can get that from Bonnie later. Okay. \nCandiceCruz:\nSo I have employee name, effective date, pay type, employment type, personal email, and phone number. \nAlia Gurtov:\nYeah, that's great. That should get us there. And I can backfill employee ID later because I know Bonnie wants that in the deduction report. \nCandiceCruz:\nI will. Can I change this to you, or what do you? How do you want it? \nAlia Gurtov:\nSince there's not a super. Sensitive data? If you're able to just email it over to me, that'd be great. \nCandiceCruz:\nYou got it all, right? \nAlia Gurtov:\nUm, I will confirm as soon as they're in there and then we can get invites out. Thank you so much for for letting me know what's up. \nCandiceCruz:\nYeah, and and this is also going to happen again in February. Okay, that's the only reason why we're grandfathering, grandfathering them in. It's because it's an acquisition, so it's not like we recruited them. And then secondly, um, Yeah, because of that and because we're, how should I put it? We want to honor them and not take away, because in rippling, so just so, you know, Rippling's not going to match their hire date. Well, yeah, it will with you. You'll be fine. \nAlia Gurtov:\nOkay. \nCandiceCruz:\nIt's my other portion, the dental and vision, that I'm going to have to try and get an override. Gotcha. Okay, I will send this over to you. And do you want me to CC Andrew since he's out, or? \nAlia Gurtov:\nUm, yeah, just cc him, but I'll get up there and I'll respond on the email so he can hit so he knows. \nCandiceCruz:\nAll right, I'll send this over right now. Thank you so much. \nAlia Gurtov:\nAll right. Thanks, Candice. Okay, bye. \n",

            "transcript": "Diane Borhani:\nHi Diane, Hi, how are you Taryn? Is that how you say your name? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nAll right? Yeah, you, you got it perfect. Um, but yeah, I'm doing well. How's it going with you? \nDiane Borhani:\nOh, it's, it's going. It's been a day, end of the day for me. Where are you at? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nIt's also end of the day for me too. I'm in a New York City myself. Where are you calling in from? \nDiane Borhani:\nOh my gosh, it is very end of the day where you. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, my days last a little longer these days than they used to, but that's okay. We're getting people enrolled for insurance, and it's just the time of the year. \nDiane Borhani:\nIt is the time of the year. Well, I'm in Phoenix, and I was curious because I saw your ad come through this weekend. I was scrolling, and I saw it. And I just wanted to make sure that I touched it. It intrigued me. I've talked to. I've had an insurance, I've had an agent that's helped us have corporate insurance for several years, have never been very happy with them. And frankly, the insurance they've got us has high deductibles, high premiums. So I only have vacillates between 10 and 15 employees all the time. Right now, I only have eight, only four wanted to, were even interested. And all four declined because they found better things on the marketplace or privately. Gotcha. So I had pretty much made the decision on Friday to not continue to offer health insurance. And decided that I was just going to give them some kind of medical stipend, health care stipend. I have lots of questions around that. And then I saw your ad and thought, let me just talk to you and see, because I had never heard. Nobody, I'd heard of ICRA. And one of the things, one of the people who wants to be part of our health plan is a partner. She only has 5%. She's at this point more an employee than a partner. She's a partner, nevertheless. And my understanding is that she can't participate if we do ICRA. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nThat is correct. Yeah. So she would still have to go to the marketplace to get her plan, But every other employee who is not a 2%. Or greater owner could use the ICHRA. \nDiane Borhani:\nOkay. So what did, so, and then I had never heard of this other thing. That was what intrigued me. I can't remember the letters, but there was some other offering that you have. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nUm, so we only do ICHRA. You may have seen QSERA. I know these acronyms are insane, but that one that starts with a Q, very similar to an ICHRA. It's just basically, it's a little bit more limited. For one thing, it's more tailored toward companies that are less than 10 employees. It also, for instance, like, just to give you an example here. So with an ICRA, you're able to class out different employees, which means that if you have, say, a full-time people and part-time people, if you'd like to, you can split that up and offer the full-time folks more in allowance than the part-time folks, right? So you can do, there's basically more you can actually do with it to tailor it around your needs as a business. Qsehra tends to be a little bit more rigid in terms of setup. It used to be the more popular one when it was the easier one to do, but since more companies like us have come out to make Ichra easy to run, it's becoming a little more popular there. \nDiane Borhani:\nDoes it change with that one, the partner status? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nNo, it's the same situation with Accusera. So basically, the problem being that, technically, as a partner, because your tax has a pass-through entity, The insurance for anyone with ownership greater than 2% can be considered a business expense instead of an expense to the employee. It's an expense to the business. So that's where that comes into play. So the reason being that the IRS doesn't want you to both have two pre-tax benefits. So that's kind of why they limit your access to ICRA, QSARA, that sort of thing. \nDiane Borhani:\nSo now that everybody, so we've spent all last week on this and gotten everybody, everybody's picked their own thing, right? So they either have, like, a private plan. I'm not even sure it's really health insurance, but it's. It's through UnitedHealthcare, so I'm hoping it's going to be okay. But it's like an indemnity plan. Have you heard of those? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nI'm not super familiar. I definitely heard of it. I'm not that familiar with how it works. That's okay. \nDiane Borhani:\nBut they either have that or they've gone through the marketplace. So I'm not sure it's really worth, at this point, your time or mine, to talk about this. But I thought, maybe you'd have an. I was looking for something that would offer me kind of pre-tax for the employees? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nWell, so here's the thing, right? So for the employees who went through the marketplace, what they could do is with the plans they've already chosen. So, say you started with Thatch today, whatever you're planning on offering them as a stipend for the marketplace, you could actually just get completely pre-tax if you went through Thatch on ICRA, meaning that they already have their plans that they picked. What they would do for their sign up is they could actually, because it's still during open enrollment, if they wanted to, they could cancel the plan and pick a new one. Or, and this actually is a very easy step for them, as they're signing up for Thatch, it will ask, hey, do you already have a plan through the marketplace? If they say yes, they can, in one step, import that plan to Thatch. So that the dollar amount you're giving them for the pre-tax stipend there goes straight from your business bank account to Thatch. To then go and pay for their marketplace plan. So. It actually, to answer your question is still something you can set up. Um, and it again, actually. It would probably probably lead to some savings in terms of just the fact that this would be pre-tax versus post tax dollars there. \nDiane Borhani:\nAnd that then eliminates the problem I would have if I. Because if I do this post tax, then I've got to offer it to everybody, right? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYou do it post tax, so, so, no. So, well, I'm not sure about post-tax, but pre-tax wise, though, with the ICRA, you would need to offer it to everyone in the same class. So, meaning that if everyone's like full time salaried employee, for instance, you'd have to offer it to all of them. You wouldn't be able to take one person out of that. But if you might have somebody who's a full time hourly employee, that would be a different one. So, so, so. Basically, you have to offer it to all employees of the same class. \nDiane Borhani:\nAnd yeah. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, you got it. And you said, you have eight folks right now, right? Right. \nDiane Borhani:\nOkay. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nAnd they're all the same class, it sounds like? \nDiane Borhani:\nWell, yes. I've got one that's a part-timer. I have one that is, everybody else is probably the same class, and then the person who's partner. Partner, right. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOkay, gotcha. Yeah. So in that case, for the folks who are an indigent, you don't need to class out if you don't want to. But the only person who wouldn't be eligible would be the partner, who would just simply keep doing. However, their insurance is being done right now. \nDiane Borhani:\nAnd what do I do for her to be able to help her out? There's just nothing. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, it's a good question. Honestly, I don't know. To my knowledge, I don't believe there would be a pre-tax way to help her out. I think it would be the stipend plan that you have to. To begin with. Okay. \nDiane Borhani:\nWell, tell me a little bit, since I have you, a little bit about your software and how it works. Sure. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nActually, yeah. You know what? Let me, let me like, let's see. I will show you a couple of things. So let me first start with here. I'm going to pull up my, my screen real quick. Can you see, can you see this? \nDiane Borhani:\nYes. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOkay, perfect. So I'll give you the quick rundown on how that works. This is going to include ICRA, but also to like what that means for running on thatch. So to give you the quick overview, at thatch, our mission is to build a healthcare system people love. So how do we do that? Well, right now, and you may be pretty familiar with this, But for small employers, generally speaking, insurance is a tough thing to do for a couple of reasons. So, first off, usually it means you need to pick one carrier with a couple plan options to fit everybody. If you're going to go the group route, which can be a little bit sticky. Because you might have someone who prefers one doctor network, a different one, and then it's hard to meet everybody's needs. Likewise, if there was ever anybody who happened to be more expensive one year for their health care, it would end up taking the premiums up for your entire group. So it just becomes like a one size fits all situation. And so that is where. Right. And you obviously know you're familiar with this, given that you're going the stipend approach. So to illustrate how this works with an ICRA, basically, what you would do is set a pre-tax budget. And then, with that budget, employees first would buy their medical plan. And then if they were to have any leftover funds, that can be worked very similarly, like an FSA account, where they can spend that on prescriptions, copays. But also they can go on to a telehealth vendor to get a specific prescription, too. So it really makes it so that they can go in a few different directions to get what they need for their care. Okay, yeah. And then also to illustrate, Thatch a bit more here. So for any given area, we have around five carriers with over 20 plan options. So this basically means that we provide a mini marketplace, if you will, for each person, depending on exactly what their Zip code is. Which is great, but obviously with more options, we want to also make sure that everybody has access to picking the proper plans that are going to be best for their care. And so that's where we come in again from two perspectives, the first one being a healthcare AI company. So we'll take into account where or who someone's doctor is, and the existing medications, information of that nature to recommend a plan that will be best for them. And then, likewise, if... They need any actual support, or they just want to talk to a real human? In terms of picking which plan works best, they can also schedule a call with our plan specialist team. And we can actually help to guide them through that plan selection process. Okay. \nDiane Borhani:\nRight. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nAnd then this actually, this is just kind of more of a fun perk that you can add in or turn off if you'd like. But one other thing that we've done at Thatch is really think more about how can we turn this concept of having leftover spending dollars into a way that really helps to support employees, not just with, you know, the medical issues they have, but also for preventative care and more, more so, wellness focused care. And so that's where we came in with this marketplace of vendors who we made individual partnerships with. And so for everything you see here, everything from fertility to mental health, sleep, also, we will take into account what they need. And then suggest vendors they can buy straight from Thatch. So it almost makes it easier to actually act on like those FSA dollars in a way, right? Instead of having to think, oh, it's the end of the year. Do I buy tons of, like contact lenses or whatnot, right? So, um, so yeah, it's a little bit on that. And then, okay, very last thing I'll cover here is just this just goes into the nuts and bolts of Thatch. But you can think of Thatch as an end-to-end medical benefits platform. So we will take care of everything from the enrollments. To compliance with the plans, making sure those are all staying up to date, all the way through to receipt verification. So if somebody bought a prescription out of pocket and they wanted to get reimbursed with their balance on thatch, they could just upload that to Thatch. And we would take care of it right for you there. And then, very lastly, payroll deductions. So this will come into account if you have somebody who buys a plan that's more expensive than their allowance, right? As in, they would have an employee. Employee contribution to give. So when that happens, it's very simply what we would. What we do at the beginning of setting up your account is integrate with your payroll. So that if any employees do have a contribution to make on their end, it would just come straight from their payroll to through to Thatch to pay for their plan, which would also happen pre tax, which is kind of nice. So their contribution would also be a little bit benefited there. But anywho, all right, well, that's my quick run through. Any any questions on anything about how that works? \nDiane Borhani:\nYeah, actually. Please ask him. So that's interesting. So it's, well, tell me cost before I start asking my questions, because I'm not sure. We really have time to change this this year, but maybe for next year, this would be a good thing, because. They're all used to coming out of their paycheck to pay for their. So nobody has anything that is less than what I'm going to give them towards. OK, so. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah. \nDiane Borhani:\nSo everybody would have to come out of payroll. So this integrates with payroll. That's interesting. OK, tell me the cost to have this. Sure. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nSo cost is there are two parts to the cost of the first, one is a forty five dollars. Per employee, per month fee, kind of similarly to if you were to work with a broker, that's the PEPM. And then the other fee is a $50 monthly compliance fee. \nDiane Borhani:\nJust a one-off $50 or per employee? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nNope, just one off per month. Yeah, you got it. Okay. \nDiane Borhani:\nYep. All right. I'm a, I think that, so this is really interesting and probably actually something that I would like to think about, but I, But given that it's six o'clock your time and four o'clock my time, practically, or seven o'clock your time. Oh, you're not three hours, you're two hours. But anyway, it's late. Let's, everybody's settled for this year. I think we should just leave it the way it is right now. I have your contact information. And I would, when you're in a slower period of time, like to see how the software works. And because I think that next year, doing this with enough planning, this could be a really good option for everybody. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, absolutely. And I think, honestly, that's a good, that's a great thing to flag. One piece I will say actually that I forgot to mention is that when you add an IFRA to... Your company, right? You actually don't need to do it within open enrollment. So anytime you add an ICRA, it actually creates a special enrollment period. So if you wanted to, you could start this for a February 1st or March 1st start date, too. It doesn't necessarily need to fall in that open enrollment period, which I don't always recommend for people, but especially in your case, though, where you do have folks who are doing marketplace plans already, it might just be a good way to see a wait a second, this is, you know, an easy way I can set up those automatic payments for my people that are also pre-tax. So just to put on your radar, to think about there. \nDiane Borhani:\nWell, that's actually very good to know. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah. \nDiane Borhani:\nSorry, just thinking here for a minute about that. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, sure thing. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Sorry. Go ahead. I was going to say, we could also plan to reconnect after the New year, too, once things settle a little bit and then go from there. Basically, like, what the next steps could look like if you were looking at like, a February 1st, March 1st start date is. I can prepare a quote for you, which will basically map out. Now, quote, quote, quote's like a funny word here at Thatch, because the thing is, it's more like a budget than a quote. In terms of, okay, here's, you know, how much I'm going to spend per month per employee. So that would be the next step is I can make one of those from your employee census and we can actually poke around with, like, what the contributions would look like. And again, it's going to be mimicking what you already do, just basically making it a bit more of an automated process for you, plus pre-tax for the employees. \nDiane Borhani:\nWell, it's the pre-tax, because that's what they're used to. And now we're going to go to this. It's going to be after taxes. And, you know, in the end, how much if I give them two, we're very small. So if I give them like. $200 a month after you tax it, they're not going to end up with hardly anything, which is why I was thinking, if we could figure out a way to do it pre-tax. What happens with the people who are on private plans? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nThat's a good question. So anytime you add that or add an ICRA, it would again trigger a special enrollment period, meaning that it's a qualified life event where they can switch plans. So they actually simply could, if they want to, they could switch into the ICRA. But if after, you know, if they look at it and they're like, oh, I think I'd rather just stay on my private plan, they could also decline coverage and stay on that plan, too. \nDiane Borhani:\nSo there's no way to take these, these plans and roll them into an ICRA, though? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nCorrect. Yeah, there wouldn't be unless, unless the private plan. I'll look into it unless it's a it's an off exchange plan coming directly from the carriers. I believe it's something different, though, where basically to make it easy. The way you can think of it is the way that this coverage type would work is. They would need to be getting plans that are either from the ACA or off exchange plans directly from the carrier, which are basically ACA plans. Those are the ones that when they're clicking through that signing up that we will show the reason why there's. On exchange and off exchange is the off exchange version is actually made. With the intention in mind of, okay, this will be a pre-tax benefit, or these will be bought with pre-tax dollars versus on exchange post-tax. \nDiane Borhani:\nSo off exchange is like, when I go on to the ACH and I basically say that, no, I don't. I know that I'm not going to be able to qualify for any subsidies. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah. \nDiane Borhani:\nOff exchange plans. Yeah, actually. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nSo those would still be on exchange. It's more like, OK, I'm being confusing. The easier way to think of it is like an off exchange plan is just coming directly from the carrier website. So if I went to UHC.com and bought a plan from there, that's off exchange. If I went to... The marketplace and bought a UHC plan that'd be on exchange. \nDiane Borhani:\nYeah, well, you can't hardly even go to United Healthcare and get an off exchange plan, they send you right back over to marketplace. But um, because I spent a lot of time last week looking. So these, I think these are different plans, even though they're backed by United Healthcare and they're within the United Healthcare. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, probably. So so then this is just my suggestion there would be. If you do want to contribute to those, it would just simply be with what you're doing already. So continue doing the post tax versus the pre tax. But yeah. Or, of course, if they do see the plans and the stipend they get, there's a good chance they'll get a better deal going through that anyway. So they might be more inclined to switch. \nDiane Borhani:\nBut OK, let's do that if you don't mind. Why don't you send me, send a suggestion what works for you for after the New year? And let's get back together and talk about it. Perfect. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, that sounds like a plan, Diane. Yeah, well, I appreciate you grabbing time with me. So thank you for booking it. Yeah, thank you. \nDiane Borhani:\nI know today's a busy day for you guys. So thank you. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, of course. So happy to dedicate time to folks who get as far as you do into that, actually. So, and do your research. It definitely makes it easier to have the conversation. So, okay, perfect. I'll send on over a follow-up email then. And then we can look at the new year for finding time. To reconnect. Do you, do you have a general time that works best for you during the week? \nDiane Borhani:\nWell, unfortunately for you, afternoon's better for me. So. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nI mean, Hey, that's okay. I, I, as you can see, I am, I'm here and we are, we are, we are cooking this afternoon. \nDiane Borhani:\nSo, um, you know, sometime after two, Arizona time is really good for me. If you could make that work. Okay. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah. Yeah. After two, Arizona time works, works great for me too. That's like, what four o'clock, my time. Yeah. That's, that's perfect. \nDiane Borhani:\nFour or five year time. So. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOkay. Perfect. You know, actually, you know, while I have you before we go back and forth over. Email is, let's see, just looking at my calendar, would like mid January, like, maybe the 13th work well for you. \nDiane Borhani:\nLet me just look real quick. January 13. Yep, that should be just fine. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nAll right, perfect. I will stick a time on them. We will do like, see, you could do two to. I'm actually fully open that day. So whatever works best for you. \nDiane Borhani:\nSo yeah, there's Tuesday, the 13th would be great. Two o'clock, my time would be great. Two o'clock, your time. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nPerfect. That's for my time. All right, great. Then I will send over an invitation then, so that we have it on the books. Perfect. Well, if you need anything else from me in the meantime, Diane, feel free to reach out. But until then, I'll talk to you in the New year. Great. \nDiane Borhani:\nWell, thank you very much. And good luck today getting through your day. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nThanks. All right, have a great one. Bye. Bye-bye. \n",

            "transcript": "Joseph Firenzi:\nHey, Sasha, how are you doing? \nSasha Kaletsky:\nHey, good, thanks. How are you? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nNot too bad, just jumping back into the week here in the chaos of open enrollment season, but having fun with it with the team. Yeah. \nSasha Kaletsky:\nOh, yeah, open enrollment system, that's relevant to you guys, right? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah, so essentially, we did a very vast... Amount of our business all in Q4, because that's when everyone gets their benefits. So it really condenses the amount of work in this quarter for us. But it's been fun and a lot of cool things as well. But Neve, we'd love to dive in if that's okay with you. Sometimes these meetings get down to the wire in terms of having enough time to get to all the material. By way of a quick introduction. My name is Joe. I'm on the business team here at Thatch. The goal for this conversation is just going to be to learn more about your team and benefits. Needs. To see if we can be a great fit for you there. To kick things off, though, would love to learn about the landscape of your team. So like the number of W-2s that would be using the platform. And also would love to hear about what got you interested in Thatch initially. \nSasha Kaletsky:\nYeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So. I run a VC fund. I'm currently the only W2 employee, and I've only just made myself a W2. And I pay myself with deal. I've just signed up. I need insurance for myself and my wife. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nOkay. \nSasha Kaletsky:\nAnd she's probably going to get pregnant next year, so it's pretty important that we get it ASAP. And yeah, that's, I've got a contractor who works in South Africa, and I've got a co-founder who doesn't, who takes money out of our UK entity. So he's not really, he isn't, we don't w2 him, and he's based in London anyway. So, yeah, as far as the identity is concerned, I've each had one W2. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nOkay. Got it. Do you have a follow-up question? Because there are some tax implications for owners. I'm assuming you are one of the owners of the business. Is that correct? Yeah, yeah, yeah. \nSasha Kaletsky:\nI'm the primary owner of the business. Yeah. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nOkay. Yeah. I was curious, then, how the business is filed for tax purposes. So is it like an S-corp, a C-corp, LLC? \nSasha Kaletsky:\nIt's an LLC. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nOkay. And then LLCs can actually be taxed either as a pass-through entity or as a delaware C-corp. \nSasha Kaletsky:\nI'm pretty sure it's taxed as a pass-through entity. I'm pretty sure, because... \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah. So... In that case, you will actually need to go to the government state exchange to purchase a plan. And I'll explain why in a second here. So Thatch actually offers a lot of pre-tax dollars for people to access. That's what I want, yeah. Yeah. So, S-Corp owners or any other kind of pass-through entity owner are already able to access pre-tax dollars through their business. So the I.R.S would see just the owners of those kinds of pass-through entities as using thatch as double dipping. Pre-tax dollars, which is why just the owners themselves would need to go to the government exchange. Hypothetically, if you had other non-owner W-2s, they could take advantage of those pre-tax dollars we offer there. But happy to answer any questions. I know there's a lot of moving pieces there, and then I will send you the link right now. Have you heard of the Government Exchange before? I have, yes. \nSasha Kaletsky:\nIt's New York State Exchange. I have, yeah, I have. I think it's very expensive. So I was hoping to find a way to use pre-tax dollars. You're saying I will be able to use pre-tax dollars? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYou can't use the pre-tax funds on Thatch. \nSasha Kaletsky:\nSo you would be saying, I could in my government if I use the government New York State thing, I can. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYou can purchase a plan there. \nSasha Kaletsky:\nIt's just pre-tax dollars. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYes. Well, you're as a pass-through entity owner, you'll be able to get some kind of break at the end of the year. If you speak to your CPA or however you file. Basically, you'll just go to this portal here that I sent you and then you'll look at all the plans there. And then, because you're in New York, there actually are going to be some more options available on the Government Exchange there. And the reason for that is that there's two kinds of Icra plans. There's on the exchange, you're on this government website, and then there's something called third party Icra administrators, which is what Thatch is. And then, for whatever reason, there's only six plans available in New York. In downtown New York for the third-party Icra administrators. There is kind of a workaround, though, if hypothetically, you hire more employees and you want to let them use the extra pre-tax dollars that Thatch offers. They can purchase a plan on the government exchange and then import it to Thatch. But again, you, as the employer, will just need to keep it off of thatch because you're, um, you're already able to access pre-tax dollars with your business filing there. \nSasha Kaletsky:\nI see. So you're basically saying, I need to use the government New York State thing. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYes, that's correct. \nSasha Kaletsky:\nOkay. So I can't work with that. And then when I get employees, which I probably will within the next year or two, then I'll be able to use that and just manage it all from there. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah, yeah. That'll be a lot easier. And then there should be time, by the way, to enroll in a plan for a January start date for the exchange there. \nSasha Kaletsky:\nWouldn't have to be today. Would have to be today or tomorrow. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nI think it might be different than ours. We just extended our enrollment deadline to the 22nd. Can try to find that for you quickly. \nSasha Kaletsky:\nNo, you go ahead, please. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nI was just going to say, it's not very time consuming. The most time consuming part is just going to be evaluating all the different plan options, because there are quite a few. When it comes to ICHRAs. But in terms of like the actual technical aspects of, you know, going on there and creating your account, it's very quick. But there should be some good options on there. Let me see. Yeah. Okay, so it does look like if you wanted the coverage to begin today, or not today, If you wanted the coverage to begin in January, it looks like today might actually be the enrollment deadline. \nSasha Kaletsky:\nAnd if I'm chill with it being February, then I just need to do it by 15th of January. Yes. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nOr is this your first time using an icra plan? Yeah. So then, yeah, If it is your first time switching to one, it does trigger what's called a special enrollment period, and you can sign up on the first of any month. The thing to keep in mind, though, is that the sooner in the year that you start, the better, because Icras always function on a calendar year basis, which means. Your new plan will always renew in January. So, hypothetically, if you got started in November, you would only have two months to pay off the deductible on your plan. Before that new 2026 plan kicked in. So, in other words, the longer you have the plan throughout the year, the longer you have to pay off your deductible. But if the deductible is not a factor and you choose a $0 deductible plan, then that won't be very relevant. \nSasha Kaletsky:\nOkay, well, I appreciate it very much. That's really helpful. So I'll use that state marketplace. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah. Thank you very much. Yeah, happy to help, by the way, if you hit any snags and send any resources or put you in touch with our team, because I know there's a lot of moving pieces here. So I want to be a resource to you. \nSasha Kaletsky:\nWell, that's really appreciated. Thank you, Joseph. And then, yeah, when I do get employees, which will happen, we've raised $45 million. So we have the ability to hire people. But right now, we haven't. And so, yeah, eventually I'll live back with you guys. Cool. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nSounds good. Well, it was a pleasure meeting you, Sasha. And please feel free to reach out if you have any questions. And I hope you have a great day. All right. \nSasha Kaletsky:\nBye-bye. \n",

                "value": "Account Notes: Gabe Gibitz - Jivet's\n\nDate of Conversation: Monday, December 15, 2025  \nThatch Representative: Taryn Livingstone  \nProspect Company: Jivet's  \nLocation: Kentucky (Zip: 40291)\n\nExecutive Summary\nDiscovery call revealed that Thatch's ICHRA solution is not a fit for this prospect due to entity structure limitations. Prospect is an S-corp owner seeking Section 105 plan options, which are incompatible with ICHRA due to pass-through entity tax treatment.\n\nKey Discussion Points\n\nBusiness Context\n- Entity Type: S-corporation with single owner (Gabe Gibitz)\n- Current Structure: No W-2 employees, all contractors\n- Immediate Challenge: Health insurance costs increasing by 700% for 2026 (significant cost pressure)\n- Current Coverage: Already has existing health insurance plan; comparing marketplace and private plans\n- Income Level: Salaried out of marketplace subsidies; marketplace would cost $1,700/month\n\nInitial Interest & Exploration\n1. Section 105 Plan Investigation: Gabe was exploring hiring his wife (who already does some work for the business) to establish a Section 105 plan for family coverage\n2. Desired Outcome: Coverage for medical expenses for family (Gabe, wife, and children) through business entity\n3. Future Considerations: Mentioned interest in HRAs and QSEHRAs as business grows and adds employees\n\nCritical Discovery - Disqualification Factors\n1. Entity Type Restriction: ICHRA requires C-corp taxation for owners; S-corps are pass-through entities and already receive tax benefits on health insurance expenses (would be \"double dipping\")\n2. Sole Proprietorship Alternative Explored: Also wouldn't work due to same pass-through taxation issue\n3. Marketplace Dependency: ICHRA is built on individual ACA marketplace plans or off-exchange plans at similar rates, which doesn't align with prospect's need to avoid marketplace pricing\n4. Premium Requirement: ICHRA requires purchasing a medical plan first before accessing funds for other medical expenses\n\nEducational Moments\n- Taryn clarified that ICHRA vs QSERA differences (ICHRA offers more flexibility with class divisions)\n- Explained that S-corp owners cannot use ICHRA for themselves due to tax treatment\n- Corrected CPA misinformation: Wife CAN be W-2 employee but cannot claim owner as dependent under ICHRA\n- Clarified ICHRA is pre-tax benefit, which creates the double-dipping issue for pass-through entities\n\nStakeholders Identified\n\nProspect Side\n1. Gabe Gibitz\n   - Role: Owner, S-corp (Jivet's)\n   - Responsibility: Decision-maker for business health benefits\n   - Current Status: Seeking alternative solutions to manage 700% insurance cost increase\n\n2. Gabe's Wife\n   - Role: Potential W-2 employee (currently doing some work for business)\n   - Responsibility: Would be vehicle for Section 105 plan if viable\n   - Current Status: Not yet formally hired\n\n3. Gabe's CPA\n   - Role: Tax advisor\n   - Responsibility: Advising on entity structure and tax implications\n   - Note: Provided some incorrect information about Section 105 eligibility that was corrected during call\n\nThatch Side\n1. Taryn Livingstone\n   - Role: Sales Representative\n   - Responsibility: Discovery, education, qualification\n   - Action: Disqualified prospect due to entity structure incompatibility\n\nCritical Timestamps & Milestones\n\nEarly in Call (Minutes 1-3):\n- Context setting: Open enrollment period, health insurance cost increase discussion\n- Gabe shares 700% premium increase challenge\n\nMid-Call (Minutes 3-8):\n- Gabe explains S-corp structure and Section 105 plan exploration\n- Initial discussion of ICHRA vs QSERA\n- Confusion about whether existing health insurance plan matters\n\nCritical Turning Point (Minutes 8-12):\n- Gabe asks: \"What if I already have health insurance?\"\n- Reveals he's salaried out of marketplace ($1,700/month cost)\n- Key question: \"Is the ICRA built on the marketplace, the ACA?\" - Answer: Yes\n- Realization that ICHRA requires marketplace-based or similar pricing\n\nDisqualification Moment (Minutes 12-15):\n- Clarification that S-corp owners cannot use ICHRA due to pass-through entity taxation\n- Exploration of sole proprietorship alternative - also doesn't work\n- Gabe confirms: \"I'm not looking for an ICRA\" - \"Correct\"\n\nCall Conclusion (Minutes 15-16):\n- Mutual agreement that Thatch ICHRA is not the right solution\n- Taryn suggests consulting CPA for alternative Section 105 options\n\nNext Steps & Action Items\n\nProspect Actions\n1. Immediate: Consult with CPA about Section 105 plan alternatives that work with S-corp or sole proprietorship structures\n   - Deadline: No specific deadline set\n   - Responsible Party: Gabe Gibitz\n   - Note: Gabe acknowledged he \"doesn't know enough to advise himself\" on this topic\n\n2. Future Consideration: If entity structure changes to C-corp, or if W-2 employees are added, revisit Thatch ICHRA\n   - Timeline: Undefined (mentioned \"as business grows\")\n   - Responsible Party: Gabe Gibitz\n\nThatch Actions\n1. No immediate follow-up required - prospect disqualified due to entity structure\n2. Future Opportunity: Monitor for potential re-engagement if:\n   - Business converts to C-corp taxation\n   - Business adds W-2 employees (wife or others)\n   - Business structure changes in any way that would make ICHRA viable\n\nOpen Items\n- Gabe needs to identify viable Section 105 plan providers that work with S-corps\n- CPA consultation needed to clarify conflicting information about Section 105 eligibility\n- Alternative health insurance solutions needed to address 700% cost increase\n\nDisposition\nStatus: DISQUALIFIED - Not a fit for Thatch ICHRA  \nReason: S-corp entity structure incompatible with ICHRA tax treatment  \nFuture Opportunity: LOW (unless entity structure changes to C-corp)  \nCompetitor Intelligence: Prospect exploring private plans and Section 105 alternatives outside marketplace\n\nAdditional Notes\n- Prospect was well-prepared and had done research on Section 105 plans\n- Demonstrated understanding of tax implications and entity structures\n- Significant cost pressure (700% increase) indicates strong motivation to find solution\n- Geographic location: Kentucky (40291 zip code)\n- Family coverage needed (2 adults + children)\n- No current employees, all contractors - limits group plan options"

Thank you. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah. How are you? Doing great. It's a Monday. It's open enrollment. So again, people send it for health insurance. Can't complain. \nGabe Gibitz:\nIt's nuts. Fun fact, my health insurance is going to go up by 700% for the next year. 700%? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOh, yeah. I think that might be, you may win the trophy for the highest increase I've heard. Holy crap, that's crazy. \nGabe Gibitz:\nI know, it's nuts. It was like the business has grown and then I lost tax credits. And so it was like all those, it was like a perfect storm, all put together. And so I'm looking for other, I have my hand on another couple options, but it's going to be off of the market. But anyway, that's a side. So that was just a fun fact for a Monday. All right. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nAll right. \nGabe Gibitz:\nSo how much did I tell you in terms of, like, the info about what I'm looking for? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOh, man. Okay, let me just double check, actually, because you did do your homework, right? And you got back to that email? \nGabe Gibitz:\nI don't know. I don't know how much I included in the sign-up for it. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOh, you know, actually, I don't think I even. I don't think I saw all the info here for Jivet's. Yeah, never mind. All right, give me the rundown. Yeah, tell me more. And also, by the way, like, just to give you a preface of this call, like, My goal is really to learn more about what your goals are regarding benefits, insurance, that sort of thing, where your head's at, and then we'll see if what we do at Thatch can help. But, yeah, please, I'll open the floor to you to give the rundown. \nGabe Gibitz:\nOkay. Yeah, so S-corp with, like... Single owner right now, no employees. I have all contractors and so I'm looking at. Like, exploring a section 105 plan. Like hiring my wife on in the business because she's already doing some work, I'm hiring her on and then doing a Section 105 plan through her. And I know that I need some like third part, or it's good to have some third party like that things in place, like you all, to do something like that. So my main question is, that's what I'm looking to do. As the business grows, you know, offering things like HRAS and like more options for employees. Down the road is going to be like a QCRA. Or like those kinds of things will be things that I'm looking into. But for right now, I'm looking at a Section 105 plan. So do you guys do those? And like, help people in my situation. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, so to give you, so we do an icra only. So we don't do QSERA, we do ICRAs. I'm happy to also send over like a link comparing the two. But basically, icras tend to be a little bit better because they're more flexible, meaning that you can actually divide up in different classes with an ICRA. So, for instance, if you have full-time people and part-time people, and you want to give them different amounts for their health insurance, you can do that. Whereas a QSERA needs to be the same amount for everybody. Okay. Also, to let you know, though, so I was going to ask, would you also be looking to get coverage through the 105 plan, or are you also planning to do that elsewhere? \nGabe Gibitz:\nMy understanding from my CPA is that I can't do a Section 105 plan because I'm the owner of the S-Corp. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOkay. Yeah. I just want to double check with you that they... That you have a good CPA. They didn't tell you the right information there. Yes, correct. \nGabe Gibitz:\nOkay, good. But my understanding, too, is that my wife can't be an employee of the S-Corp. It has to be a sole proprietor or a C-Corp. Is that correct? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nInteresting. So if she's looking to get covered, say, with a NICRA, I believe, and I'll double check on this with you. This comes up, honestly, a lot on our end. I believe she can be a W-2 employee. And get the ICRA, she just wouldn't be able to claim you as a dependent, and you cannot claim her as a dependent. So as far as health insurance goes, you just need to be like separate entities. Yeah. \nGabe Gibitz:\nBut if my understanding, too, is that if I run her through a sole prop, which I already have, which already does work for the business. Or like, provide services for the business, then it could cover everybody. Is that correct? Because it would be through a sole prop. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nUm, SolProp also would not work because of the, it's taxed like an s-corp in a partnership, I believe. So basically, taxation wise, the only way for you to get coverage would be if you're taxed strictly. As a C-corp. With like nothing else, um, would be the way to do it there. \nGabe Gibitz:\nOkay. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOkay. \nGabe Gibitz:\nSo let's, let's leave that hoop to jump through. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOkay. \nGabe Gibitz:\nUm, so then if we end up doing that. Um, like, what kind of plans do you all have as options? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, sure thing, I I'll pull that up in a second, actually. So we can, we can, you know, let's do this. I. We can spot check really quickly to see what the plans are on our end. And then, if you want, I can also just do the quick like run through on, like, just how Icara on Thatch works, what it looks like, that sort of thing. But let me let me show you this. So basically, um, here, let me share my screen. So to give you the quick look into plans, what you can do is go to put this up. Uh, oopsies. Oh no, I just got totally. wait, sorry, give me one second. Okay, there we go, sometimes when I there, we go. perfect. Um, okay. So Thatch.com plans, so this is just a public link you can use to actually view the plans in your area. So if we just whip up like a quick fake employee here, uh, what's a good Zip code to use? 40291. 221, Kentucky. All right. Boom. So what we're seeing here is basically the plan options that would be available for your area. And so what you can do is you can firstly sort. \nGabe Gibitz:\nSo what if I'm maybe this is part that may not do my homework. What if I, What if I already have health insurance? What if I already have a plan? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOh, through the marketplace. You mean, right? Potentially. \nGabe Gibitz:\nI'm comparing marketplace plans, and then I'm also looking at a couple private plans as well. Gotcha. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nSo basically, the way it works with the Nicra is you can get coverage three ways. So the first way is through the ACA, which would, in this case, with Thatch, How it works is you would go to the state marketplace, buy a plan there. And then as... An employee is signing up to Thatch, they would be able to import their plan from the marketplace to Thatch. It's just a very quick thing where we take down what the name of the plan is, premium costs, that sort of thing. And so then, on your end, you can set up the reimbursement to happen automatically, where you have an auto pay that goes to the marketplace. Not a very hard process, but the easiest one for us, though, is we already have all these plans in place. So as employees are signing up, they can actually go through. \nGabe Gibitz:\nAnd let's, let's pause then, so let's okay, so the just for some framework. So, like, I already have a health insurance plan and I'm already paying for that. So I'm not like, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't really need that. I'm looking for, like the Section 105 plan of covering like health care expenses. For the family through my wife, that's what I'm looking for. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nDoes that make sense? Yeah, for the family through your wife. So okay to give you another lay of the land here? So with an Icra? How it works is, and actually, this is like, not a bad transition for me to just pull up this slide right here. So how it works is like this. When you set that budget, so like, what the reimbursement amount is going to be monthly? Yep, in order to use that, you would need to buy a medical plan with the IcRa first. So you can't just make an account that's just for buying on medical expenses, like in this case, examples are prescriptions. We have a telehealth vendor here, right? So, in order to access those leftover funds, you would first need to buy the medical premium. All right. \nGabe Gibitz:\nYeah. Now I'm confused. Okay. So the, maybe I need you to back up a step. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOkay. \nGabe Gibitz:\nMaybe I jumped in too far. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOkay. \nGabe Gibitz:\nSo tell me what an icra is. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nSure thing. Yeah, happy to do so. So basically, like to give you the illustration here, an ICRA is long acronym stands for individual coverage health reimbursement arrangement. Now, the individual coverage portion of that means that every plan that people can buy on Icra is an individual plan. So that is a plan that they can purchase directly from the marketplace, or they can buy an off exchange version of the plan. Basically, what that means is. They can either go through an ICHRA vendor, where we already have a list of plans directly from carriers, or they can do an import one from the marketplace. So that's the individual coverage portion of it. Now, that is what when you set this budget. \nGabe Gibitz:\nWhat if I can't use the marketplace? What if I've salaried out of the marketplace? And I can't use it, can can you? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOh, um, you can always use the marketplace. So, like, when you say salaried out, you mean if like, as in like, if you make too much money, or like, um, yes, like. \nGabe Gibitz:\nIt doesn't make any sense anymore to use the marketplace at like, where I'm at with income, so that's why I'm looking elsewhere. Like, it's going to cost me $1,700 a month if I use the marketplace next year. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nGotcha. \nGabe Gibitz:\nYeah. So is the Icra built on the marketplace, the ACA? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYes. So to answer your question, it's built on individual plans, which are the ACA plans and plans directly from carriers. So the rates that you're seeing on the marketplace, right, in terms of just what the raw rates are. With no subsidy, that's going to be the same rate that we will take that will be on the ICRA. Now the benefit with the ICRa, though, is as an employer, you're able to. Basically, if you do want to cover health insurance, you can put this budget in place, which is pre tax. So this actually doesn't get taxed, as it doesn't get taxed actually when it goes directly to pay for the plan. So there is that little break, which is nice compared to if you were to give, for instance, a stipend. That's post-tax, or goes directly to your employees salaries for them to then use to buy their plans. You wouldn't be getting that pre-tax benefit, so that's kind of the difference there. But to answer your question, yes, these are market this is basically built off the marketplace. Plans, or at least in that price range. Off exchange plans tend to be pretty similar in that regard. Okay, so so I can't use an off exchange plan? Sorry, you can't use an off exchange plan. So, do you mean you specifically as the owner? \nGabe Gibitz:\nWell, my goal is just to get coverage for my family. So, the two of us and then our kids. And then to then also have the business through the section 105 plan cover. The medical expenses very similar to this throughout the year. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nSo got it. Okay. So, yeah, that makes sense to me. Oh, yeah. Sorry, go on. Go ahead. Oh, yeah, I was just going to say like that, that makes sense to me. So what would happen for you is if you were to use a NICRA, I'll just kind of illustrate what it would look like. So if you were to be on a NICRA, you would. Then, for your family's plan, either go to the marketplace or go directly to a carrier to buy the plan. Going direct to carrier is basically one way of shopping for plans, but it's going to end up being pretty similar plans in the marketplace. It'll be kind of mirroring those plans if you will. Um, so that is what you would do if you were on Nikra. Whereas your employees would then have the have that to buy their plans on, so they would get this budget from you. \nGabe Gibitz:\nI don't have them, I just have my wife. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, okay, yeah, just around the same page. Gotcha. And are you planning on adding any employees at any point this year, or will it just be you guys? No gotcha? Okay, yeah, so so honestly, in that case, like, I mean, the. The issue with the Icra is the same thing that your your CPA mentioned, like you wouldn't be able to use, um, the Icra for yourself as an S Corp owner. Um, so, yeah, honestly, like, when it comes to these sorts of scenarios, usually it's better for us in terms. Or it's tough. Because the only way you'd be able to use it is if you were a C Corp. But but like, that's, that's what would come into play here if you were trying. \nGabe Gibitz:\nSo let's say we have a sole proprietorship. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, so the issue is the entity type. So, sole Props are also pass-through entities in addition to S-Corps, Which is why, because you can actually include the expense of your health insurance as a business expense, believe, if I'm saying that correctly. That's why they basically already have a bit of a tax benefit on it, so it would be considered double dipping if you were to do it twice. \nGabe Gibitz:\nBecause the Icra always pays for the health insurance premiums. Is that right? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, and the icra is pre-tax. If the icra was post-tax, if this was entirely a post-tax thing, then it would be fine. But the way Icras work is, it's a pre-tax benefit. \nGabe Gibitz:\nOkay, I think that makes sense. So then I'm not looking for an ICRA. Correct. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nI would say you're not looking for an ICRA. Um, unfortunately, but that that's okay, it happens sometimes, so this one, so this won't work, it won't work, sadly. Yes, you're right. sorry, I should have clarified that, like earlier into our call, but yes, um, yes, correct. So it wouldn't work because Ikra needs to be with Um, basically entity type, if you're an owner, that's a Um, a C Corp, or tax as a C Corp. \nGabe Gibitz:\nOkay, um, Okay. I feel like there are then other options out there. I'll talk to my CPA then. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, I would talk to your CPA. I know. I wish I knew, like, I wish I had more knowledge in the back of my head. with, like, all of the different, like, you know, different types of options. QSERA. \nGabe Gibitz:\nI mean, this is really specific, and really, I mean, I know this is really specific, so. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYes. Yeah. QSERA, I think you'd run into the same issue, but. Yeah, I would ask again about the Section 105 plans and see if there is something that could be a solution there. \nGabe Gibitz:\nI just like, don't know enough to advise myself, Okay, so then if we did a Section 105 plan with you, it would? We would need to pay for the health insurance through a C-Corp off of the marketplace, is that right? Um, or through you, through us? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, I mean, basically through us. But again, yeah, the plans are going to be similar to what's on the marketplace as far as that goes. Yeah. Okay. \nGabe Gibitz:\nThen I think, I think that's all I need then. Right. I think so. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah. Okay. I think that may be it. But yeah, but any who gave, I mean, again, thanks for grabbing time, though. I know I wish it could be a better fit, but that's okay. If you do ever need me, though, please, you can feel free to reach out. I'm happy to help or answer any other questions you might have. So just let me know. \nGabe Gibitz:\nAll right. Sounds great. Thanks. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nThanks so much. You too. Bye. \n",

            "transcript": "Taryn Livingstone:\nThank you. Hey, Brian. \nBrian Timmer:\nHi there. How are you doing? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nHey, I'm doing good. How's it going with you? \nBrian Timmer:\nGood, thanks. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nGood, good. Well, thanks for hopping on. Happy Monday. \nBrian Timmer:\nYeah, likewise. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nAll right. Well, I think we could, we could pop right on into it. Just to give you a quick preface, a quick intro first. I'm Taryn on the business team here at Thatch. So I work primarily with companies under 15 employees, hence why we are talking right now. Really, my goal for the call today is just simply to hear more about what your goals are regarding benefits, insurance, What sparked your interest in Thatch, and then we'll see if we can support you from there. \nBrian Timmer:\nCool. So I've got a little company out in the desert in California that has a small group of employees who I want to provide some health reimbursement to. Just because we don't sponsor a group plan. And their premiums are just becoming excessive. So I figured it'd be a little bit less expensive than giving them consistent raises that we have in the past, better for everybody. So that's why we're talking. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nCool. Yeah, it totally makes sense. And how many employees are you looking to offer this to? \nBrian Timmer:\nInitially, it'd probably just be the salaried employees. So it'll be somewhere between three and five of the 40 or so. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOkay, great. Yeah, perfect. Yeah, you're definitely hitting the nail on the head with with an ICRA. And we'll get into this a little bit in a bit. But basically, it lets you give a stipend that's pre tax for employees to use on their health insurance plan. So basically, makes it so that you can kick in some as an employer and help to, you know, pay for their insurance overall. So, um, essentially how it works. Are you? Are you familiar with the at all? \nBrian Timmer:\nYeah, I, I get the the benefits, so we can probably just skip that part. That's, um, yeah, I, I follow all of that. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOh, great, okay, perfect. And then um. So coverage start date when are you looking to get this in place? By? Um, early next year, early next, all right, great, and it early as in like, like super early, like 1st of Jan, or more like February start date? Potentially. \nBrian Timmer:\nOkay. Yeah, it really just comes down to how quick the process is. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nAll right. Yeah, that sounds great. On our end, the process is actually like very quick. So, essentially, and I'll actually show you how to do it right now. Come to think of it here, let me pull it up on my end. So, basically, the deadlines to keep in mind for right now is the. Latest you can create your account as an employer. Is the 19th of December, if you're looking at a one-one start date, which is just end of this week. And then employees would have until the 28th of December to enroll in a plan. \nBrian Timmer:\nAnd I could isolate those employees to just salaried full-time employees, right? It doesn't have to be all full-time employees? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nCorrect. Yeah, you got it. So you could just offer it to them. That would just be considered making a carve-out, which is very simple for a nikra. There's a few different ways to do it. You can do it by state. Salary versus hourly is a very popular one, so that definitely works. \nBrian Timmer:\nOkay. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nAll right. So with that, let me actually here, I'm going to pull up my screen and show you how to allowances with that works. And then I'll kind of walk you through what the experience looks like. \nBrian Timmer:\nSo. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nAll right. So the screen that you see right here, this is exactly what you would get to if you just simply went to that dot com and hit Start now. It would just take you through a quick little sign up process. This is all self-serve, by the way. And then eventually you get to the screen here where you'd actually upload your employees. \nBrian Timmer:\nAnd so you have to upload everybody. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nNot, um, that's a good question. Uh, cause I know you're only offering it to your, to, to the smaller group. I'll actually get back to you on that. I'm fairly certain that the answer is, you do have to. So as far as invitations, invites go to thatch and inviting employees, you only have to invite employees who are all in the same class. So in this case, if you're, if you're offering it to one person who's full-time salaried, you'll have to offer it to everyone who's full-time salaried, right? \nBrian Timmer:\nYeah. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nSo that you definitely need to upload as far as uploading your entire list of like 40 employees goes. I don't think you have to do that. I think you can, just you can just upload those. \nBrian Timmer:\nThe reason I ask is they did get a lot of turnover. So it's just another thing to like, upload and manage and then get rid of when they quit or whatever. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, no, that totally makes sense. I think you'd honestly just be fine with uploading the four, the three to four. I'll double check and look it back to you. But Okay, so how it works is you'd upload your employees, and this is just going to take in some very basic info. So like, what their name is, email. The main thing that matters in terms of pricing for Thatch is date of birth and ZiP code and dependent count. That's going to take us into account what it would actually cost to offer plans to them. So save changes, go next step. All right, it will give you back a little census, just to say, does everything here look good? And then, if you did, for instance, know that there's an employee who is going to be on their spouse's plan, you could always uncheck this box. And we'll show you what that does later on. But that just gives you a more accurate cost estimate of what it will actually be. Because if someone uses their spouse's plan, they won't actually be on your plan, right? So, all right, looks good to me. I'm just going to click through here to get to the allowances. All right. So with allowances, there are two ways you can set them. And just to remind you, allowances are going to be the way in which an employee actually buys health insurance, right? And so with allowances, we'll just jump to this slide very quickly. Basically, when you set the budget here, what that will do is it will give employees the ability to first buy their medical plan. And this only will come into play if you happen to set up a budget that's above what the common prices for premiums. If they did have leftover, that could be spent on prescriptions, co-pays, really any eligible medical expense, or even telehealth services, too. So yeah, just a quick view here. Any questions on, like, how this works? \nBrian Timmer:\nNo, I do have a question about the plan. Like, can they self-enroll in a separate plan? Correct. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nSo for our plans, they can, there's basically, they can either go through Thatch. So with our plans, we have like for any given Zip code, and we can actually look it up for where you are. Over in California. You're in California, right? \nBrian Timmer:\nYeah, they'll, yeah, they all are in California. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOkay, perfect. So we can actually take a quick look at what the plans look like for that area that they're in. But basically, they can either go through the ACA, buy a plan, import that plan to Thatch, and then... In that case, what they'll be able to do is use the budget that you're setting for them to help pay for their plan. Or they could also buy a plan through us. So we have a whole marketplace of plans that we actually go straight to the insurance carriers and sell through them. That's called an off-exchange plan versus an on-exchange being on the ACA. The main difference there is off-exchange plans can be purchased with... Pre-tax dollars for both the employer contribution, so what you're kicking in, plus the employee contribution is also pre-tax, so it's an extra benefit in that. \nBrian Timmer:\nIn that case, why do you say the employee contribution, you mean their premium, right? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nExactly? So, so, basically, like, so they'll take this example. So imagine if, um, this employee got had a budget of 750 a month, but she went and bought a plan that's a thousand dollars a month. That would mean that the employer is covering $750 of that. \nBrian Timmer:\nSorry about that. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nEmployers covering $750 of that. And the employee would then be covering that other $250, right, if they buy a $1,000 a month plan, that $250 is the employee contribution. That is pre-tax if they buy an off-exchange plan through the ICRA. \nBrian Timmer:\nWhen you say that pre-tax, what do you mean? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nSure. Basically, it means that when you pay your employee, right, so like they're getting their payroll through you, they're able to not have the portion that's going toward their insurance be taxed. \nBrian Timmer:\nI get it. So the portion that if they buy through you, as opposed to just going direct through the ACA. If they buy through you, the incremental portion of the premium that I don't cover will be tax-free. As opposed to, I guess, yeah, it'll be taxed. Those will be post. Those would be tax dollars that they're using. Okay, I get it. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, perfect. You got it super clearly. Okay, great. So with that, going back to how we set allowances, right? You can either do it by setting a flat amount for everybody. So very straightforward. In this case, everyone gets $900 a month. The only issue that this causes, though, is that plans are not priced evenly, right? So people who are older are going to have more expensive plans. Than people who might be younger. And so the same dollar amount might get someone who's younger, further than someone who's a little bit older. So how we account for that is with smart allowances. So this is basically taking into account where somebody lives, how old they are, and also how many dependents. They have to recommend a dollar amount that gives everybody the same purchasing power. \nBrian Timmer:\nAllowed to do that? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nGreat question. The answer is Yes, however, you need to be extremely careful with basically using a formula that takes this into account, which is why we made this formula for you. \nBrian Timmer:\nIn other words, there's a very limited set of characteristics that you can basically build to differentiate them as a class. Is that kind of the idea? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nCorrect. So this is mostly taking into account age banding. Um, location banding. And I'm. And of course, like if they have more dependents. So, to answer your question, if everyone's in the same class you need to take into? You can only play around with these three factors to to change how much they would get, how, like, how do they have to be? \nBrian Timmer:\nCan you differentiate drastically between a 26 year old and a 28 year old? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nIt's not going to be that drastic. And you can actually see when you upload your employee list, you'll see what the difference is. I got it. \nBrian Timmer:\nSo there's a formula that you guys are generating on the back end that is within the allowable limits. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nExactly. So we take care of that compliance piece for you so you don't have to worry about just getting nothing. Yeah, if somebody's compliant or not. But yeah, to better illustrate this, though, here I'll head on over to smart Allowance. So this is just using San Francisco as a zip code example. But Basically, what you're looking at here is how to configure allowances. So the first way of doing that is picking the coverage level you want to offer everybody. So, say you want to offer everyone is able to afford the lowest cost option. That's like a bronze plan, best fit for you, silver plan, better benefits, gold plan in their area. And then also dependent coverage, you can set to 25, 50 percent. And you notice that when I change this around. The only people who are getting a different allowance will be the people who have dependents. \nBrian Timmer:\nYeah, I'm literally just going to give them a fixed amount. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nyeah, just fixed. Okay, perfect. So if we do fixed amount, um, so like, or like, same dollar amount for everyone, you mean, or, or okay, sweet. That's also quite easy, um, actually much easier. So if we go over here like, say, like, we just like, put it to like, I don't know, we do, just do that and skip. For an example, so basically, like. The one thing that you can do fixed amounts is you can still toggle based on number of dependents if you want to do that. So that is something that you can do, but it's going to be easy. Do you have a dollar amount in mind you want to do? \nBrian Timmer:\nIt'll, I'll probably start it low and give myself some flexibility. I don't think I can go backwards. So it'll be somewhere between three and 500 bucks. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOkay, sure. So we'll just set it to 400, for instance. So, like, that's basically what it would look like. Just to let you know, I know that you see all these little compliance checks here. This actually doesn't... Okay, this comes into play. Where if you do have an employee who might be getting a very steep stipend from the marketplace, for instance, and they are given unaffordable coverage. here, you can kind of read here what that means. It's not. \nBrian Timmer:\nNone of them are getting a stipend. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOh, really? \nBrian Timmer:\nNot a meaningful one. Okay. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah. In that case, it doesn't come into play at all. Then you can basically like. The only other time this would come into play is if you have over 50 full time employees, where you need to give a minimum amount. In this case, you don't. So that also doesn't matter. All right. Perfect. So basically, what you'll do is you'll put it in here. And then, and once it all looks good to go, you'd hit review. Just to quickly cover on our end. So our fees are a $45 per employee per month fee. So similar to what brokers would charge there, and then a $50 per month compliance fee. That's a flat fee. \nBrian Timmer:\nSo it's $50 for effectively for the platform, not per employee? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nNot per employee, right? \nBrian Timmer:\nOkay, so it's 45 per employee, plus just a platform fee of 50. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, I got it. And if you had like five employees, for instance, this would. This would be the amount right here monthly. \nBrian Timmer:\nGot it. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYep. And then. Oh, lastly, another thing you can check, too, is if you wanted to just see what the plan options look like. If you just click on See plans, it will then load what the different plans are in their area. So this was just going to give give you a little view. So if you know people like Kaiser, for instance, you can filter through that and it'll show what the Kaiser plans are that are available to them. \nBrian Timmer:\nGot it. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah. \nBrian Timmer:\nAnd is it terribly difficult for them to do this than to upload a plan of their own? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nNo, it's honestly not. I actually did it for myself. Come to think of it. Basically, once they get to the signup screen, there will be a little, a little like question prompts that says, Oh, do you have your own plan? If they click through that, they're just, it's going to be like a one screen upload. They'll just load what their premium payment is, name of the plan carrier, that sort of thing. And then what basically happens is they'll set up an auto pay, so it'll go straight from Thatch to marketplace to cover their plan. There. Got it? Yep, yeah, you got it all. Good questions? Um, yeah, any, any other, any other questions or things I can help clarify. \nBrian Timmer:\nHow do they handle reimbursements? Do they have to come in every month? is there any way to, like, integrate it in so they don't have to come in constantly to get their reimbursement? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nSure. When you're saying reimbursement, you're talking about, like, you reimbursing the plan that they're picking, right? Correct. \nBrian Timmer:\nYeah. The 400 bucks, as an example. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah. So actually what we would do is what we do is we integrate with payroll providers. So when you pay them, it's going to automatically, oh, sorry, not payroll providers. We would just take down your bank account information. So, on a monthly basis, it's that the amount that you're looking to reimburse them for would just go straight from your bank account to Thatch. When it comes to Thatch, it would go straight from Thatch to the carrier for the plan that they selected. So that all happens automatically. \nBrian Timmer:\nBut in terms of, yeah, I mean, I get that part, but how, how do you know that they've, say, paid their premium? Because, like, in other words, all right. I don't want to pay them in from a compliance perspective. I can't imagine they should be getting the $400 reimbursement if they drop their coverage, as an example. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOh, yeah. So you mean, like, as in, if they opt out of coverage from the beginning, or? \nBrian Timmer:\nNo, like, let's say, Alice Johnson has a $600 monthly premium. And by the way, I can. I can let them spend that on medical coverage as well, like not just premiums, right? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nGreat question. So it would go to the premium first before, like anything else. Yeah, yeah. But like, so, for instance, though, like, say, like, so, say like you gave, I don't know, like if you gave Bob a $400 stipend, like most of the plans here, right? He would be paying some out of pocket, too. So there wouldn't be any like leftover to pay for, like co-pays or anything like that. Yeah, you got it. but... \nBrian Timmer:\nIf Alice or Bob, or whatever the name is, no longer has coverage, how do you know that I shouldn't be reimbursing them anymore? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOh, we would. We would know if they, if they, if they enroll in a plan. I honestly don't know if you can, though, like, once they enroll in a plan, that they're locked into that plan until a qualifying life event happens. \nBrian Timmer:\nWell, they can stop paying. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nThey could stop paying. Like, you mean, on their end with the. OK, so basically, if that happens, then that's a good question. We would just look into it from our team. So, if for some reason. Um, well, so again, just to illustrate the flow of funds here, right? In this case, $400, right, is coming from your bank account to business bank account to pay for the premium. This other $300 is coming from their payroll directly to Thatch to pay for the premium. So in both cases, the money is going to get to their insurance provider without them having to do anything. \nBrian Timmer:\nAh, okay. That's okay. Okay, so instead of that... And does this apply even if it's a manually uploaded medical plan that they've enrolled in themselves? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYes, this also applies. Because when they basically they would just set up an auto pay so that the so like, they're prompted to do that. It'll walk through how to do that for them. \nBrian Timmer:\nI get it. So you guys are clearing. So you guys are basically forcing the money through you guys to ensure that. You know, when somebody like unenrolls or something like that. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nExactly. Yes. Yeah. \nBrian Timmer:\nAnd that's probably what gets you the pre-tax treatment on the Icra too, on like, the entire amount. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYes, probably. I mean, with that, it just comes down to the fact that it's like, these are off exchange plans. And with an ICRA in general, it's going to be pre-tax for the employer contribution. But yeah, you have it right, though. We do control the flow of funds, and the main reason being. Exactly what you mentioned for like, we don't want any delinquencies to happen, meaning missed payments, people not doing whatever they need to do. And so far we've had, we're at a zero percent delinquency across the board. So that that's why we're very tight on controls there as far as like how funds flow. \nBrian Timmer:\nWell, yeah, I mean, you've you control, zero percent. People want to get their paycheck, so right, yeah, exactly, you just pull it from the paycheck, Correct. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYes. Yeah, I would just go straight from the paycheck. \nBrian Timmer:\nI get it. Okay. So in that case, they don't really have to come in and prove, like, upload a statement of a premium payment or anything like that. And it's really, that's never going to be relevant for a medical bill, as long as I'm providing them with only like three to five hundred bucks. Because that's always going to be below, be below the amount of the premium that they're paying anyways. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYes, correct, yeah, and so so basically, I mean, it's, it's, it's just that. So they basically have to do nothing, basically have to do nothing, actually. Yes, the only thing they have to do, and the only thing you, so basically, the only two things that have to happen. You would need to just pick what you want for allowances, which you already have in mind, right? How much you want to set for that year. And then they would need to just pick their plan by the 28th of this month if they want the coverage. Start date for the 1st of January. Got it. \nBrian Timmer:\nYeah. Okay. And then, from a payroll perspective, who do you integrate with? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOh, that's a great question. So we integrate with pretty much any of the big ones you can think of, QuickBooks, ADP. We also integrate with... Payrolls that are a little more mom and pop boutique, we can just takes a couple extra steps to set up. But once it's set up, it's set up. So we could do whatever works best for you. Which one do you use? \nBrian Timmer:\nThey use, I think they use Quickbooks payroll right now. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOh, perfect. Yeah. Quickbooks is one that we are closely integrated with. So that's an easy one for us to work with. \nBrian Timmer:\nIs it so all of that's automated on the integration side? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, basically. So if I actually let me see if I can just click through this. So going to review next step. Sounds good. Boom. Okay, so there's quickbooks right there. So I would actually just select this is a demo environment. So it's not real. But basically, they would integrate from here. Got it. Yeah. \nBrian Timmer:\nSo do they have to do, somebody have to go in and do anything on on each payroll? Does anything get done or no? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nUm, so it doesn't, I think I may have broken it. Unfortunately, that's okay. Definitely not demo environment, not made to go all the way through. So as far as what they have to go in and do, basically, once you set it up, and you upload your like, census of employees, right, the whole list there, then it will be taken care of. As far as the payroll goes, it'll just go automatically from the payroll to whatever. That difference is that the employees that need to make up for. \nBrian Timmer:\nOkay. And they don't need, so whoever's running payroll doesn't need to go in and, like, perform a bunch of additional tasks? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nNo, it's all automated. Yeah, we've tried to automate quite literally as much of this as possible, especially for admins. So yeah, once it's all set up, it's good to go there. \nBrian Timmer:\nOkay. Well, I think the only thing that I have outstanding then is just the question of... Who I need to upload, which of the employees need to get uploaded and which don't. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, true, that. I'm going to reach out to my team right now and just like, double check there. Fairly certain you'd really need to only upload the five, but I'll get back to you on that later. \nBrian Timmer:\nIt might be everybody from a compliance standpoint, if there's like some incremental requirement, once you have a certain amount of employees or something. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, I know. And you're a total at 40, right? You said? \nBrian Timmer:\nSay that again? \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYour total employee count you mentioned was 40, right? \nBrian Timmer:\nSomething like that. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah. And those are mostly part-time people, right? \nBrian Timmer:\nNo, there's, I'd say, over 80% are full-time. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nOh, okay. Got it. But they're hourly, full-time, you mentioned? \nBrian Timmer:\nAll the balance other than the three to five are hourly. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nGot it. Okay, nice. Yeah. In that case? That's good context. I'll double check and get back to you there. But it should just be, again, the other thing I will say, actually, is. If you do need to upload everybody, it would just simply be you download a census template and throw everyone into that and upload it. So not too many other steps, but I'll double check to see if you even need to do that. \nBrian Timmer:\nOkay. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nAll right. Cool. \nBrian Timmer:\nSweet. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nAny other questions I can help answer, Brian? These are all great questions. \nBrian Timmer:\nI think that's it. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nAll right. Perfect. Well, then, in that case, as far as next steps go, we kind of did already cover this. But basically, if you want to get this set up for your full-time salaried folks for a 1-1 coverage start date, you just want to act on it. This week. So, to set up your account by the 19th. And then, once that's good to go, they will have until the 28th to select plans. So they do have a little bit more time to review and pick something that works best for them. \nBrian Timmer:\nOkay. Are there any questions that I haven't asked that, like? People find out later with these plans and they're like, thrown off or annoyed, or like, you know what, I'm asking, anything I'm missing. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah, it's a great question, I think the one thing I would recommend that you do, and I will send this in the follow-up email anyway. But I'll just show you here, for for the sake of it is if you go to Thatch.com, slash plans, that is going to show you here. Let's go boom. It's going to load a view that looks like this, where I can put in and some information here. And then what's a good Zip code for your area? 92252 is where most of them are located. Okay, perfect. So I would say this is the number one thing in terms of what you'd want to do a quick check on before, or just in general, to have an idea of, like, what your employees will see. So again, if they need anything, or even also like, you know, if they want to check for doctors, prescriptions, whatever. They can reach right up directly out to our support team and we will actually hop right on that and let them check to see what they. If there's anything specific that they need, if they want to check for coverage on a specific network, whatever it might be. So, um, anyway, just wanted to show you this because this is going to be what they see, too. And so the great thing is that, yeah, you have like a lot of options that people usually end up getting held up on. Like there are PPos they can pick from, they have, um, there's low deductible, there's also pretty low premium plans as well. So, you know, yeah, not too, too terrible. High deductibles, though, here, obviously. But yeah, yeah, I think. In general, though, I mean, just from a quick spot check, it looks like you'll be a good fit for a NECRA. But yeah, OK. All right. Well, perfect. If you didn't anything else, Brian, again, I'll shoot you a follow up with what we talked about. Also, double checking on that employee upload. And the next step really would just simply be to go make an account, start looking at the plan, set your budget, and then you can be fully self-serve from there. So that is how it works. Perfect. \nBrian Timmer:\nI think I get it. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nAll right. Sweet. Okay. If you need anything again, just feel free to shoot me an email and I'll follow up with you soon. \nBrian Timmer:\nI appreciate it. \nTaryn Livingstone:\nYeah. Sure thing. It was good to chat with you. Bye-bye. Likewise. \nBrian Timmer:\nBye-bye. \n",

            "transcript": "Joseph Firenzi:\nHello. How are you doing today? I can't hear you. Can you hear me now? \nrachel:\nHello? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nOh, there you are. \nrachel:\nYeah, wow, that's weird. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah, I didn't think I was off mute, but glad it's working. Where are you calling in from? \nrachel:\nI'm in San Diego. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nOkay, very nice. Haven't spent too much time down there, but I did go to Chapman University in Orange County, if you've heard of it. \nrachel:\nI have, yes. Is that an art school? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah, I guess it's considered an art school. They have a really good film program, But I was a business major and then started my career in film, and then, after the pandemic, transitioned into tech stuff. \nrachel:\nCool, cool. Are you in, where are you located? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nSo the past four years, I've actually been living in Austin, Texas, now. So mixed it up a little bit to get outside of California. \nrachel:\nGreat. I don't know if Alana is joining us. I'm his chief of staff. So I'm here as proxy and, yeah, excited to explore Batch. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nCool. Yeah, I'd love to dive right in here. Sometimes these meetings do get down to the wire in terms of having enough time to get to all the material. Material. But by way of a super quick introduction, my name is Joe. I'm on the business team here at Thatch, and the goal for this conversation is just going to be to learn more about your team. And benefits. Needs. To see if we can be a great fit there. To kick things off, though, I'd love to learn about the landscape of your team. So, like the number of W-2s that would be using Thatch and needing benefits, as well as what initially caught your interest in us. \nrachel:\nI don't know how Alon found you, but he sent me your URL. And we're a very early company and we're just trying to set up a competitive benefits package right off the bat. So we don't have any competitive benefits right now. We just have, like, baseline health care. We do offer, like, in the meantime, before we're setting up the official benefits, we have a fifteen hundred dollar a year wellness stipend that folks can spend however they want and submit for reimbursement. But we want to build in like actual infrastructure in terms of benefits. And we know that there's like a lot of different niche places, like Carrot and Maven, or like Family building. And I'm actually not clear if that has a, like, a specific niche in terms of benefits and health and wellness, but interested in learning more about it. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nOkay, cool. So are there currently anyone, like any people on the team, that would be needing benefits in January, or what was the desired start date? ASAP. \nrachel:\nDefinitely January, in January. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nSo, yeah, we actually did just extend our enrollment deadline. It was originally going to be today, but now people will have at least until the 22nd. And it is pretty quick and easy to get your account set up. I'll show you what that's going to look like today. But essentially, as long as your team members that need healthcare in January get enrolled in a plan by the 22nd of December, they will have coverage beginning in January. Cool. \nrachel:\nGood to know. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nAnd then how many people on the team currently would be using the platform? And are any of the people that would potentially be using Thatch owners of the business? \nrachel:\nYes, there's five full-time employees. One of them is Alon, who's the owner. And I think the team will grow pretty quickly at the beginning of next year. I don't know how many folks yet, but that will depend on our fundraising, which is ongoing and looking very likely. But it will likely grow from five. One of them is the owner, and everybody else is in California. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nOK, cool. And then do you have a follow up question? Because there are potentially tax implications for owners. I was curious how the business is currently filed for tax purposes. So is it like a C Corp, an S Corp? \nrachel:\nIt is a C Corp. C? OK, perfect. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nSo c Corps. Or, I should say C-Corp owners are unrestricted and they can purchase a plan directly on the plan page that we have. And that way, the owner alone can take advantage of the pre-tax dollars that we offer. Hypothetically, if he had the business filed as a pass-through entity, such as an S-Corp, he would actually need to go to the healthcare.gov website. Because there's less pre-tax dollars to be offered there. And yeah, basically, the IRS would see an S-Corp owner as purchasing a plan on Thatch as double dipping in pre-tax dollars. \nrachel:\nBut I see. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah, he doesn't have to worry about that, he or she. Okay. Yeah, he. Well, cool. Unless you have any other notes or questions for me, I would love to dive into the thash side of things, and then I should cover... A great deal of what you might be thinking about there, but feel free to interrupt me if you have any questions along the way. \nrachel:\nWe'll do one second, then. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nCool, can you see this page? \nrachel:\nI can perfect? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nUm, so, this first slide just highlights how the typical group insurance model has functioned over the years. Basically, the employer would go out and choose only one to three plan options for the entire team to use. But because people have very different health care needs and different backgrounds, locking them into just only a couple plan options might not be the best path forward. One of the many cool things about an ICHRA plan on that is that. You will present the option for your team to choose any plan in the Zip code that they live in. I believe in California, that's going to be at around 40. But if you do have a remote team and people that live in other cities, there are actually states with well over 100 different plan options. So there should be, you know, at least one in there, out of all those options. That should be the best fit for not only the employee, but also for any potential family members that they add as dependents to their plan. And then, at a high level overview, this is how Thatch is going to function. So, at the top of the screen, there is an example of that monthly allowance that you can distribute to your team to help them purchase a health care plan. This will be pre-tax for the business. So that's very nice there. And for the sake of this example, we'll call this individual here, Stacey, and say she works for you. You'll send that invite email out to Stacey that says, hey, we're going to use Thatch this year. Please accept the monthly allowance I have designated for you and create an account. Which only takes about five minutes, and then go on our Plan selection page and choose any plan you like best. She goes and does just that, But the plan she ends up choosing is only $500 per month with that medical premium, which means she would have $250 left over monthly. With those surplus dollars, she can actually spend those in the same way as an FSA. At Thatch, we call those leftover dollars qualified medical expenses, and some examples of ways that people can spend those dollars are on things like prescriptions. therapy, dental costs, and many other items that the I.R.S. has deemed to be qualified. You are required to enroll in a medical plan before accessing any potential leftover dollars, which means it's not an option to decline coverage and then only have the pre-tax FSA account. These funds that you could have in surplus also roll over month to month throughout the entire calendar year, so people can save them up. But if at the end of December, any employees forgot to use their surplus dollars, their balance will reset to zero. And then in January, they can start saving them up once again. The surplus funds are not pre-distributed to team members, which means they always just sit in the business bank account awaiting an eligible reimbursement or transaction. And that also means, if people forgot to spend those dollars, that those funds will just remain in the business bank account. Because they never left. And then on the bottom of the screen, we are looking at the Thatch card. This is just going to be the most efficient way to spend those surplus dollars. There's both a digital and physical version of this upon request, But people can also use a personal payment method and then upload a transaction onto their Thatch portal for reimbursement with the pre-tax funds there. And then, going back to the top of the screen, we can now flip the script here and ask the question, what happens if Stacey finds a plan that is $850? So $100 more than that. Allowance that she's currently receiving from the employer. In this instance, when someone chooses a plan that costs more than the allowance, Thatch will sync with your payroll provider and automatically withdraw those funds, which allows people to use pre-tax dollars as well to cover a cost-sharing scenario. So thatch is actually pre-taxed both for the business with that initial allowance distribution, and pre-taxed for the employees. In the instance, they choose a plan that costs more than that allowance. I want to pause here and see if you have any questions so far. \nrachel:\nOh, not yet. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nCool. So we are, of course, partnered with all the major healthcare carriers in the country. It's going to be the same plans, essentially, that you would see with group insurance and function in the same way. There are, of course, many other regional carriers to choose from, depending on where you live. And then. I know it can seem like a tall task to ask your team to go through 40 or 100 different plans and figure out which one is the best option, But after some helpful filters and questions on our plan selection page, only about 15% of employees end up needing assistance. And if they still need help, we actually offer live support, So there will be a button on that plan selection page where you can schedule a phone call with one of our licensed benefits experts. And then on top of that, there is also a pretty advanced AI chatbot that is custom built around healthcare benefits questions, which is pretty useful. Cool. And then this is an extension of ways to spend those dollars that you could have in surplus. So this is the Thatch Marketplace, and this will be available right on the employee portal. And as you can see on the right, we are partnered with a number of different health care brands. There's many more available on the Thatch marketplace when you log into your account. But we have a bunch of discounts with these brands. And basically, all of these have been pre-approved by the IRS to be qualified medical expenses, Which means, if you do save up enough of those dollars month over month, you can certainly purchase one of these items if you would like to. People see this as an awesome added perk and benefit on top of just standard healthcare coverage, But this really only comes into play if you do have a surplus of funds, which means if you choose a plan that costs more than the allowance, this won't really be. Then final slide here, people choose that over other third party Icra administrators. Because we are truly the only end-to-end tech platform that handles all the good stuff I have mentioned already. As well as everything else that you're looking at on the screen here. So we will, of course, make sure you're staying compliant and won't get dinged for anything there. Assist with receipt verification during tax filing season and upload official documents for you. We have best-in-class support that answers questions in a very fast amount of time. And what all of this means for you as the employer? At the end of the day is that you really only have to worry about one thing one time a year, and it is coming up. With that allowance strategy for the team, and then everything else will be on autopilot for you. So we do want to make it as easy as possible to roll out great benefits for your team. So you can actually focus on doing the work that you do there. But I'd love to transition to the demo environment. So I can show you what that calculator will look like, because there's a lot of different stuff you can do there. We do have one of two ways of proceeding. The first of which is I could upload a couple of your employees' real information. So I would just need their date of birth, number of dependents, and the Zip code they live in. And then that way we can get some real cost projections together. Or, if you don't have that handy, I could upload some fake data. \nrachel:\nLet's use the fake data. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nOkay. So what you're looking at here is going to be the real signup experience, by the way. And I will send you a link to access this after the call. The thing I want to call out, though, is that nothing is finalized with Fatch until you send that invite email out to employees. Which means you can use the same calculator freely on your own time without making anything official. So it is a very valuable, free tool for you to use and play around with. So you can look at the cost, projections and stuff like that for your team. You'll just use the question. \nrachel:\nSo do the employees enter the information, or am I allowed to ask how many dependents they have or they fill this out? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah, great question. So you will just use this calculator to come up. With the allowance like strategy. In other words, like how much funds to give the team. Then, at the end of the day, when you send that invite email for the employee to create their account, that's when they decide, like, okay, do I want to add my spouse to my plan? Or, like, do I want to add like my children to my plan? Or are they going on my spouse's plan? So that will be up to them at the end of the day. You're essentially just coming up with the possibility of them unlocking extra dollars for having dependents, if that makes sense. \nrachel:\nOkay, got it. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nI'll explain more in just a second here, but. I uploaded two fake employees, the first of which is Max. He's 25, with no dependents and lives in San Francisco. Olivia lives in Austin, Texas. She is 45, with a spouse and child. I will show you what this looks like here. You'll choose your start date. So, yeah, you'll choose January. And then you'll eventually hit this page. And there's two main ways you can go about your allowance strategy. The first of, which on the left hand side, is very simple. You can give everyone on the team the same dollar amount if you want to. In this example, it's $900 each. But if we look at the bottom of the screen, we can actually see the costs of their medical plans are very different. And the reason for this is that with Icra plans, insurance carriers price the plans based off three details, which are going to be someone's age, the Zip code they live in, and then also the number of dependents they add to their plan will all heavily influence the price tag, which is why this person in the middle. Has such a higher cost than her colleagues next to her. On the right hand side, we are looking at Thatch's dynamic calculator. And you are allowed to give people a different allowance, but only if that different allowance is structured off of age, Zip code, and number of dependents. Sometimes people ask me if you can tier the allowances based off of job title or seniority at a company. That's actually considered non-compliant because that has nothing to do with how the insurance carriers price their plans. But we'll move forward here and I'll show you how this comes to life. And then, with these default settings, we can see how the dynamic calculator comes into play. So again, Olivia is 20 years older than Max, and she has two dependents on her plan. And that is why she would be receiving, you know, twice as much here as Max, because the calculator is mirroring how the insurance carriers price the plans and then giving her an appropriate allowance to accommodate that increase in cost. There's a lot of stuff you can change here and, you know, essentially make it whatever you want to. But the first thing you can do is edit the dependent coverage amount. So you could click 0%. We'll see this move down immediately. And then, if you selected this option, you'd be asking the employee to cover the entire cost that comes with adding dependents to their plan. And then, you know, there's different selections here. This will only be available to people when they add dependents to that plan. So if someone doesn't have any, they won't get this extra balance. \nrachel:\nAre you allowed to differ, like if somebody has a dependent? I thought it was illegal to change how much you offered to cover them, like depending on how many dependents they had. It was either they have dependents or they don't have dependents. Does that ring a bell? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nSo it's not illegal. You can certainly adjust the amount based on the amount of dependents someone has. Interesting. \nrachel:\nOkay. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah. On the Icra plans here, that directly correlates to the price of the plan. So that's why, you know, it makes sense to adjust. Accordingly, because the cost for each dependent. \nrachel:\nOkay. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nBut you can also adjust at the employee level. So you could do lowest cost, which will kind of base the allowances off of higher deductible, less expensive plans. And then you can do better benefits and we'll see this go up. And then it's basing the allowance off of lower deductible, more expensive plans. And best fit for you is kind of one in the middle there. And then also kind of a custom one, based on some questions on the previous page. And then you can also hit this custom tab and adjust the slider accordingly. The thing to call out here is that it works together with the inputs up top. So, in other words, 90% with better benefits will be different than 90% with lowest cost. The second thing to call out is that just because it says a percentage here does not mean you will be covering 90% of any plan they choose. There's so many plans on ICRAs. That it would create far too much unpredictability with cost control for employers if they were to cover 90% of any plan. So that means the number you see here will be the allowance they receive each month, regardless of that plan they decide on. Then I want to click into the employees here, and this is the coolest, most valuable part about the calculator. So I'll use Olivia as an example, and we'll click See plans next to her name. And you can do this with any employee that that you've uploaded into the calculator. She's currently getting $1,483 each month. There's 90 plans in her Zip code. And I'll scroll down and we see two plans right off the bat. This gold plan, here with a lower deductible, the family deductible, has a red number of $675 under it. That means the entire cost of this plan is not covered in full by the allowance she's currently receiving. And then Olivia would have to do a $675 pre-tax payroll deduction to cover the cost difference each month. This plan is covered in full and that is why we are seeing a green number of 196. Olivia would have a surplus of $196 each month that she could then spend on those qualified medical expenses. So this is a very valuable aspect of the tool for you as the employer to dial in the allowance strategy until you reach something you're happy with. You can sort by metal, tier and different stuff here to get a look at different plans and what. The cost sharing will be based on each possible plan that they might enroll in. Pretty neat stuff there. I was curious if you had, like, any initial thoughts on the allowance amount, or maybe, like, a total monthly amount that you were looking to stay under as the business? \nrachel:\nNo, I'm just trying to wrap my head around this as like such a new model of benefits. It's where the industry needs to go. But so as a company, that's like, how long have you guys been around and how many? Users do you surface? Like, not companies, but like, how many people do you have on the platform? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nSo Icarus were actually created at the end of 2019, and Thatch was created, I think about year and a half afterwards. I don't know if I can provide the exact information on the amount of clients we have, just in terms of like internal data and stuff, But we are a leading. Third-party icra administrator, for sure. Our CEO and another representative on our team actually speaks with Congress members regularly to help our government shape the future of Icra laws and regulations. And how this should function moving forward. So we're very, very plugged into the space. We are also funded by the most prominent venture capitalist firms in Silicon Valley, including Anderson Horowitz, General Catalyst, and many other ones as well. I'm happy to provide any information on that stuff, but sorry, did you have any other questions around that? \nrachel:\nYeah. Who would you say is your biggest competitor? Like, if you're one of the leaders, who else is big in this space for ICRA? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nThere's one called Venter. There's another one called Takemand. Those are the two that come up the most often, I'd say. \nrachel:\nAnd why doesn't everyone do this? Like, are they just not, they're just antiquated? Like, why isn't everyone going for this sort of health infrastructure? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nLike every business? \nrachel:\nYeah. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah, great question. In some instances, Icra can be more cost competitive and more affordable for businesses. And then in others, group insurance can be more cost affordable. It really just comes down to age, Zip code and number of dependents for the employees, because that's how it's on the Icra side of things. And then it also comes down to that renewal quote that they're getting with the group insurance, of course. So this year, I can actually show you this if you want to, which is pretty interesting. The renewal rates were pretty crazy across the board. \nrachel:\nLike for group plans? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nFor everyone. Yeah. So I'm going to scroll down. Here we go. So here's the observed rate increase for each state. And you can see, Arkansas is a 46% rate increase in just this year alone. There's a lot of ones in the 30s. I'd say the average is about 15 to 30. But that is, you know, very unsustainable moving forward. \nrachel:\nYeah. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nBecause then, like every three years, we can see the rates double, which is wild. But yeah, really, we have this whole process for doing a cost analysis against group insurance rates. And then, you know, that's essentially how we figure out if we're going to be more affordable or less affordable. \nrachel:\nOkay. And so our health insurance renewal is in September. And so how does it work if we're on rippling and we're mid-year? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nOh, are you guys currently on a plan right now? \nrachel:\nYeah, we are. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nOkay. Yeah, I think that comes down to your ability to exit that, you know, contract or plan if you are able to switch over now. I'm not sure how restricted you would be there. \nrachel:\nI feel like we would be very restrictive because Rippling is our broker and they are sharks. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah, I can look into that more and see what we might be able to do. But I will say if it's your first time switching to an icra plan, or I should say if you're switching from a group plan to an ICRA. It does trigger a special enrollment period, and you can sign up on the first of any month throughout the year, except for December. So hypothetically, if you were to exit that, you could sign up on the first of any month. But it is better to sign up earlier in the year because all Icra plans always function on a calendar year basis. So that means, hypothetically, if you got started November 1st, you would only have two months to pay off your deductible plan before your 2026 plan kicked in. Regardless of the month that you sign up in your new 20, your new plan for the following year will always start in January. \nrachel:\nOkay. Okay. So I think the long pole or the stage gate is determining if we can change. And then, yeah, understood we would want to start this in the beginning of the year. I doubt we'll get an answer by January 1st, just going into the holidays and everything, but we could target February 1st. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nOkay. \nrachel:\nOnce we get an answer. Cool. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nAnd then I want to call out that, you know, this does add together all the allowances here and then also adds in the thatch fees. So the fees to use our platform are going to be forty five dollars per enrolled employee per month. If you have someone that declines coverage to go on a spouse's plan, you will not be charged for them. And then there is also a fifty dollar monthly compliance fee, but that stays flat at fifty dollars, regardless of headcount. So if you have one person on that or five on that, that will stay at fifty. We do have some slight wiggle room on those fees there. So if you're interested in a potential discount, please let me know over email and I'll see what I can do there. And then also want to call out that. After you finalize your allowances and you send the invites out to your team members, the allowance structure will be locked for the year, which means you cannot update it in the middle of the season. So definitely want to be mindful of it. And that also means the same inputs you decide on now will be applied to future hires in 2026. Okay. And again, you can play around with this as much as you want. And nothing will be finalized because you had not invited the employees. So feel free to use this as like a nice cost projection calculator tool. And yeah, happy to answer any questions you might have along the way. \nrachel:\nOK, yeah, thanks. I'll definitely forward the resources to Elan too. But do you have any advice on how to determine if we can get out of the plan? Is that a question to our insurance provider, or is that a question for Rippling? \nJoseph Firenzi:\nYeah, that would probably... Be rippling. \nrachel:\nOkay. Yeah. Okay. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nIt might be challenging depending on how that functions and how those plans are structured. \nrachel:\nYeah. I mean, we're so small. We're probably on some, like other small group plan. So I'll ask them. Okay. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nAnd then if you have any questions on that, too, I can loop in our support team that might have more knowledge on that. They're pretty awesome and they can be reached at support at thatch.ai or .com. Either one will work. Okay. \nrachel:\nYeah, great. No, yeah, we'll parse through these resources. I'll talk to Alon about it tomorrow and then I'll be in touch this week with any questions. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nOkay, cool. It was great to meet you, Rachel. Please let me know if I can help. And yeah, excited to help if anything comes up. Yeah. \nrachel:\nOkay. Thank you. Nice to meet you. You too. \nJoseph Firenzi:\nBye. See you. \n",

            "transcript": "Mason:\nHello, can you hear me? \nSummerset Inga:\nHi, Mason. \nMason:\nHow are you? How are you? \nSummerset Inga:\nHow are you? How are you? \nMason:\nI'm good. How are you doing? \nSummerset Inga:\nAll for a Monday, not bad. You guys getting sun up there? \nMason:\nI haven't seen the sun in like three weeks. \nSummerset Inga:\nWe've had... We have had sun every day. Oh, wow. We have no winter, no snow. \nMason:\nOkay. All right, then. \nCaroline Clark:\nHey, Mason. How's it going? \nMason:\nHi, Caroline. Good. How are you doing? \nCaroline Clark:\nGood. Happy Monday. Glad we were able to find some time to connect so we can get everything squared away. Bye. Bye. \nSummerset Inga:\nYou guys, too. \nCaroline Clark:\nHow are you guys? \nSummerset Inga:\nGood. \nCaroline Clark:\nAwesome. Okay, let's get into things. So we have enough time just to kind of like, you know, make sure employees get invited. Mason, do you mind sharing your screen with me and we can walk through how you invite employees? \nMason:\nLet me just remember how to do this here. \nSummerset Inga:\nIs Mason the one who's going to invite the employees versus the bombs? \nCaroline Clark:\nVersus Who are the bombs? \nSummerset Inga:\nMe and Shahana. \nCaroline Clark:\nWhat does bom stand for? \nMason:\nIt's office Managers. \nCaroline Clark:\nIt doesn't matter. Mason can add you guys as admins and you guys can invite people. It doesn't, we'll add you guys as admins so you have access to all of it. It doesn't matter who admin invites employees. Okay. Can you please go to your employer dashboard for both groups? \nMason:\nHow do I move this? All right. So do I need to go through the, is that a different thing than what you would initially send me the first time? \nCaroline Clark:\nSo, did you complete your employer profile with the links I sent you last week? \nMason:\nI did. Okay. \nCaroline Clark:\nSo I need you to log into those accounts that you created. \nMason:\nOkay. Let me. \nCaroline Clark:\nYou would just go to Thatch.com slash login. \nMason:\nOh, okay. I'm wondering if I saved my Thatch.com slash login. Let me just try. \nCaroline Clark:\nSo log in at the top right corner. Oh, just go to log in at the top right corner. Okay, so log in to your account. So you had one for memory care, one for MC, and one for AL. \nMason:\nI might have forgotten my password. Hold on. Okay. \nCaroline Clark:\nDid you create one for each account, like I sent the links for, or is it just the one? \nMason:\nI think. I believe it was just memory care because I ran into that issue linking it early. So I don't think I made one for AL, but I can make one real quick. \nCaroline Clark:\nWell, okay, so let's just do the first one. Let's just do one at a time. Did you connect your bank account? So, first of all, so this is for, so this is for memory care. Do these employees look correct? Like, are they associated with the right account? Because you said you might have switched the lists. \nMason:\nYeah, this, this is for, if this is, this is Memory Care's roster. \nCaroline Clark:\nOkay. So it's correct. \nMason:\nYes. \nCaroline Clark:\nOkay. So what you're going to do, so it said you? Your company is not fully onboarded, can you finish onboarding? \nMason:\nWell? This is where I kept running into the method to connect my payroll. \nCaroline Clark:\nSo hit agree, yeah, hit agree, continue, skip, skip, skip, skip. Um, put in how you run payroll. And then first payday example, second payday. Like, okay, and then on weekends how you want that you can make changes. Okay, then click next, continue. Okay. Now you got to connect your bank account before you invite employees. \nMason:\nUh, let me stop sharing real quick, just to make sure, yeah, yeah, stop sharing. Okay, you can't see it anymore, no more. \nSummerset Inga:\nOkay, Shoot, I thought I was going to get a long vacation. \nCaroline Clark:\nSo, Mason, while you're doing that, okay, perfect. So, yeah, you do that first while you connect instantly through Plaid, then it'll take you to your admin dashboard. \nSummerset Inga:\nCarolyn, are our employees still going on to ease for the vision and the dental, and then they're going? To thatch for the medical? \nCaroline Clark:\nDid you guys, Mason, did you guys decide to include thatch, dental, and vision? I think I had, or did you want to keep it separately? \nMason:\nNo, we were still doing what we did before with Michumulipaha. \nCaroline Clark:\nOkay, perfect. So that's the answer. So it sounds like... Because I have not heard from anybody from EASE. \nAnna:\nAnd I've looked multiple times throughout the day and I don't see anything for 2026. \nCaroline Clark:\nOkay, yeah. So you guys are administering then dental vision separately through FACT. So that's something that you guys can talk to HuB about separately. \nMason:\nJessica Reyes's number, Inga. \nSummerset Inga:\nYeah, I mean, I've been emailing her and she's gone silent. \nMason:\nI know she went on, she was, she should be back. I know she was going to San Francisco, but she should be, she can sometimes be hit or miss, but she's like, the best. I mean, Jason usually doesn't respond very often. I think he's dealing with other stuff, but that should be your contact. Yeah. \nSummerset Inga:\nYou ever. \nMason:\nYeah. \nAnna:\nShe did send an email. I think it was last week saying she would circle back with us, but. Yeah. \nCaroline Clark:\nI was emailing her today, so why don't I just email her and say... Do you have her phone number, Inga, or are you just texting her or emailing her? \nSummerset Inga:\nOh, I have both. \nMason:\nOh, you do? Okay. \nCaroline Clark:\nYeah, I'm emailing her just to let her know. Amen. \nMason:\nAll right. So I have connected to it. Okay. Let me go back to. Okay. \nCaroline Clark:\nYeah. Share your screen. Okay. Awesome. So does this look correct? So once you invite employees, you can't change. So if you need to, like. Okay, so see, first of all, what we're going to do is go into settings to the left. So you're all good to go. All you have to do is invite employees. But let's add. Inga and Anna as additional admin. \nAnna:\nSo if you scroll down Anna, it's I couldn't change it. I'm Shauna. \nCaroline Clark:\nOh, Shauna. so sorry. Um, okay, so see where it says add administrator. So you're gonna add both of them? \nMason:\nOkay? well, they're, they're for each building, so this one will just be Shauna. Okay, Um, do I need to do their full name? or can it just be a, or do you want me to do your full name? \nAnna:\nIf it needs to be, Dash, P-I-E-R-C. \nCaroline Clark:\nYeah, just do first, last name, and then email. \nAnna:\nI know I have a long name. \nCaroline Clark:\nAnd then, Sean, you'll receive an email from DAsh to be able to log into this portal. \nAnna:\nPerfect. \nCaroline Clark:\nSo, okay. With this, so now go back to employees at the top left. So. I need you before. So all you're going to need to do to invite employees is you're going to select all and then click invite. But I need you to make sure that all these this was based off that census you sent me. So we can't make any. It's going to be hard to make any changes once. We just want to make sure this all looks correct before you invite them. Like, they all look like they're OK. \nAnna:\nI combed through it this morning. So, hopefully. \nCaroline Clark:\nOh, you got access to. OK, perfect. So you can actually. If you're ready to go, you can select All and click invite. So are we sending? \nSummerset Inga:\nAre we sending this notice to part-time employees as well? \nCaroline Clark:\nIt sounds like you guys were just offering it to full-time. So just, I mean, just invite, or just invite the employees that you're offering benefits to. \nMason:\nI know I have to, I just don't send the invitation to anyone that's part-time. \nCaroline Clark:\nDon't send it to part-time employees. Yeah. \nAnna:\nAnd then how do we, so if they switch, so some team members, they'll be full-time and then all of a sudden they'll, they decide, no, I'm only available. Part-time and we change their status in ADP. How do we change their status in, so Uriah is actually full-time. She was listed full-time on that sheet I sent you. \nCaroline Clark:\nSo this is like I was getting, so click on the three dots so you guys can edit any changes. Click on the three dots. \nAnna:\nThat's exactly what I was asking. \nCaroline Clark:\nSo then go to part-time switch. \nMason:\nDo I need to change the start date or I guess it doesn't, I don't know if that matters. Let's do it. \nAnna:\nThe same start date. \nMason:\nOkay, perfect. \nCaroline Clark:\nSo you guys can also edit the names too. So for like the other group, all you guys need to do is like, there's any changes as opposed to editing on the census. You can just edit it in here. \nAnna:\nThere's a few other people that are matching. So I don't know if you want to wait. \nCaroline Clark:\nSo maybe wait to invite them so you guys can go in. No, we'll wait. \nMason:\nOkay. \nCaroline Clark:\nBut you know how to invite employees now. So you're good to go once everything looks correct. \nAnna:\nAnd does it just generate like a generic email, or do we have to? \nCaroline Clark:\nYeah, it'll trigger an email to employees to create their Thatch account to pick a plan. \nSummerset Inga:\nAnd then how long do they have to, What is our open enrollment dates? \nCaroline Clark:\nSo, as long as they pick a plan by December 22nd, they will receive coverage January 1st. And something else I want to show you guys. So go. \nAnna:\nOh, is it effective today? \nCaroline Clark:\nIt'll be effective January 1st. \nAnna:\nNo, I mean, the open, like, they can enroll, like, start enrolling today. \nCaroline Clark:\nYes. So, something else I wanted to show you guys is the Resources tab to the left. This is all, any employer-facing, employee-facing resources you might need, you can find here. \nMason:\nOkay. \nCaroline Clark:\nSo, there's an employer handbook, FAQs. If you scroll down, there's a welcome email, like, communications template. Shauna, if you wanted to send out like a welcome email to employees in addition to their email link, we have templates for you to use here. \nMason:\nAnd then there's a front of reminders. \nCaroline Clark:\nOK, like any, any, like any, anything. FAQs questions you may have, like you should be able to find your like, there's plenty of resources in here. So, like an open enrollment kickoff email. So you could send that once you invite employees with two, if you'd like. \nSummerset Inga:\nWho is the medical with? What company? \nCaroline Clark:\nSo it's with a bunch of different carriers, so the employees are going to have a lot more plans to select from. So you're going to have, like many different carriers plans. You're going to have a lot more choice, a lot more deductible ranges, a lot more plan types. \nSummerset Inga:\nSo is there is there a list that we can get? \nCaroline Clark:\nYou get it, you'll get it. Once you're invited, you're going to see them all, okay, so there's no way to. \nAnna:\nUm, as I was telling Mason, sometimes we have a lot of different cultures here at the community. Will that... Information be available in other languages for those team members that maybe do not speak English as primary? \nCaroline Clark:\nYes, we have Spanish speaking brokers that they can schedule time with to help. There's going to be broker support for all employees to pick a plan. When you create your personal account, in the bottom left corner, there's going to be a button that says, Need help and support. You click on that button and it'll take you to the broker's calendar link. And you can schedule a same day appointment if you need help with this plan selection process, because you're going to have more choice. They can help you pick your plan. They can request to Spanish speakers as well. Perfect. Yeah. \nSummerset Inga:\nYeah, because I find that a lot of people want to see something on paper that they can take home and discuss with their husband. So in the past, I've always had to run like some copies, that just shows. You know, the basics and the cost and stuff. \nCaroline Clark:\nYeah. So, um, yeah, there's, it's, this is all going to be done over, over a computer. So it's all done that way, but I would recommend getting employees scheduled appointments. Um, and then we, I'm always happy to arrange appointments for people as well. \nSummerset Inga:\nUm, so they need to have an appointment in order to pick their plan, or just if they need help? \nCaroline Clark:\nNo, no, they don't need. They just need to. Oh, they need to schedule an appointment if they need help picking a plan and do it. \nAnna:\nSo we wouldn't in previous experience at other communities where people they'll ask me to be the expert. And I'm like, I don't know. \nCaroline Clark:\nOh, yeah, no, no, no. \nAnna:\nThey don't need to go through them and say, oh, you can just call that person and they'll help you, which will make it a lot easier. \nCaroline Clark:\nYeah, exactly. So we, our goal is to take that work off your plate. And then let's. \nSummerset Inga:\nSo once the employee gets the email, is the email pretty self-explanatory to someone who does not have technical knowledge? Yes. \nCaroline Clark:\nThe interface, luckily, the interface is very, very, very easy to use. Okay. \nAnna:\nCan they access it from their phone, or do they have to be on a laptop or a computer? \nCaroline Clark:\nThey can access it from their phone. It's like, it's we don't technically have an app, but it is it's optimized for a web desktop. I would recommend they do it from a computer, though, just to have a bigger screen. Like, they can access it from their phone if they'd like. But I think for everyone, it'd be easier just to do it on a computer. OK, so. Log out of your first DaCh account and then click the link. \nMason:\nYeah, do I have to log out? Because it just took me right back to the... \nCaroline Clark:\nYeah, log out of your first account. So log out and now click the link from the email for ALNC. \nSummerset Inga:\nCaroline, about how many plans do they have to choose from? \nCaroline Clark:\nI can see it depends on where they're located. You should do a different. It may make you do. Actually, sorry. No, continue. The plans will be like tens of different options. So it depends on where you're located. I don't remember. OK, so I can go into the quote. You're going to see it. Hold on one second. So you'll need to do a different. Email to create this account. What you can do is do Mbeasley plus Almc at Somerset. So this is going to be your unique login. So, you just need a different email for each account. So now create your passwords, but it's all going to go still to your regular email. So just, yeah, so just do this and then create the same password. Okay. Save that one. I'd save that in the right so you can look in. \nMason:\nOkay. \nCaroline Clark:\nSo I'm going to have to do this. \nMason:\nYeah. \nCaroline Clark:\nSo you have to go through the same process for, I uploaded your employees. So it's basically, you're going to go through the, through the same flow and then. I didn't update any of the changes you put on that sheet. I'm just going to allow you guys, you saw the three dots, just edit whoever you need to, and then you'll just invite them the same way. \nMason:\nOkay, so Inga, this will probably take me like 10 minutes. Okay. I'll do it after the call. If you could, I don't know if you already did, just verify the part-time and full-time employees. \nSummerset Inga:\nAll right, yeah. \nMason:\nYou did? Yeah. Okay, were there any changes you needed to make? \nSummerset Inga:\nNope, not that I'm aware of. \nMason:\nOkay, so if you just, well, then in that case, once I can just do this. And then I'll send the links out, I'll add you as an admin. It sounds like a way to set up an account. \nCaroline Clark:\nYeah, and just make sure the employees look correct. Because I didn't, the new census you sent me this morning, I didn't update it yet. So, like, just go through, make sure if there's any changes, you can edit them and then invite employees. Okay. \nSummerset Inga:\nAnd then all employees, whether they currently have insurance or they don't want insurance, still have to go on this link and either deny it or pick out their insurance, correct? Correct. And then is the life insurance policy that Somerset was offering for employees at no cost with you guys, or is it still through ease? \nCaroline Clark:\nThat is separate. So you're going to only offer medical through us and then everything else you'll defer to Jessica and Jason. I just sent Jessica an email saying I'm on with you guys. They're asking if you can send information about dental vision, all of that. So hopefully she'll reach out to you this afternoon. And yeah, it should be good to go. But yeah, so that should be it. And then once you invite employees, that's going to trigger them. So as long as employees pick an email, just really emphasize employees, December 22nd is the last day to ensure a January 1st coverage start date. And if you, for some reason, if you, if people need help getting those appointments, like, you can book it in, in the, in your account. But if you need help, reach out to me, I'm happy to like coordinate with you guys too. \nSummerset Inga:\nSo we. And book appointments for the employee? \nCaroline Clark:\nFor yourself, every employee will book their own appointments. I'm just saying, if someone is like, needs help navigating it, you can reach out to me and I'll help you guys. I can help employees get an appointment. Yeah. Yeah, should be pretty straightforward. Let me know if you have any other questions. Anything else that? \nSummerset Inga:\nIt would just be nice to have a basic sheet on what the options are. Because I've got employees walking into the office all day, asking questions. \nCaroline Clark:\nYeah. \nSummerset Inga:\nInstead of always saying, oh, you need to log in, you need to log in. I can just quickly. \nCaroline Clark:\nUnfortunately, we don't have, it's all going to have to be done because there's so many plan options. Like, we don't have PDFs of all the plans. But you can print them out from like the actual, like, just to show you, like, I'll just, let me. I'm going to share my screen just to kind of give you a glimpse as to why. So this is just a resource on our website. Let me share my screen. \nSummerset Inga:\nIs that an insurance broker? \nCaroline Clark:\nWe do take over as broker of record. Yes. So we are a third party administrator. So I'm putting in my name. I'm putting in my Zip code in San Francisco. I am 27. These are all the plans I have to pick from. I have 28 plans. \nSummerset Inga:\nSo like, this is what we offer our employees, so many plans. \nCaroline Clark:\nThis is what your employer decided to go with. So the goal is to give employees more choice. So this is why we can't print it out. But you can go and click in to any of the plan details here and see, you know, the summary of benefits. So you have access to all this. And then you can book an appointment with someone to help narrow down some options. \nSummerset Inga:\nSo do we have Kaiser in Nevada yet? I know Kaiser was trying to sign a contract with Renown, but I haven't heard that they signed that. So Kaiser would be our option. \nAnna:\nSo Renown, I think, bought Kaiser, or vice versa. California Kaiser is still going to stay Kaiser, but renown is going to stay renown because they're more well-known. I don't know. But what I heard today is that Kaiser is now senior care. I don't know. There's a lot. So who knows, in 2027, we may have Kaiser in Nevada, but I think right now we just have to go with what's available. It's more of an option. \nCaroline Clark:\nYeah, there's more options. You'll see all your options when you when you invite employees, and you'll log in and see all your personal options. But if there's any other questions I can help answer, let me know. I'm happy to help arrange appointments as needed. So, yeah, let me know how I can be helpful. \nAnna:\nOkay, well, thank you so much. \nCaroline Clark:\nYeah, of course. Have a great day. \nMason:\nUm, while I have you. Sorry Shauna. If you want to just confirm, Um, I don't know if you already sent that email. \nAnna:\nNo, I have. I did receive the email. I just haven't. Um, I'll confirm it now and just let me know. \nMason:\nI'm just finishing up setting up the account and then I'll be done here in a couple minutes. Okay, I'm just linking the bank account now and then I. I'm just going to go ahead and send those out. Okay. And then we should be. \nSummerset Inga:\nAnd then, once you're done, Mason, I should get a link or something to set up or be able to log in as an admin. I think so. \nMason:\nThat's how it works, right, Caroline? \nCaroline Clark:\nOnce you add her as an admin, you'll get the email. Okay. \nMason:\nPerfect. \nSummerset Inga:\nAnd then do you know anything about employees have received a video? \nAnna:\nThat would have came from EASE. I saw something that was sent through Ease or from Ease, saying basically get ready for benefits. There is nothing. Yeah, there was nothing specific about the insurance. I watched it myself just to see what it was. \nSummerset Inga:\nAnd I didn't get any emails or notifications for ease. \nCaroline Clark:\nI just heard back from Jessica saying she's going to send you guys all that information. \nSummerset Inga:\nOkay. And then I have another employee that received their new benefit card and they haven't even enrolled yet. \nCaroline Clark:\nOkay. \nAnna:\nYeah. I received something the other day myself in the mail, but I was like, oh, that's weird. This is, I just figured, oh, it's not valid. I'm like, I don't even know what we're having yet. \nCaroline Clark:\nSo yeah, that I don't, I think you guys, yeah. Maybe schedule a call with Jessica to talk about everything else that might've been like, separate. Um, but like medical, everything's going to be through Fatch. Yeah. \nSummerset Inga:\nUm, yeah, it was a medical card. \nAnna:\nSo how do we, because we just unfortunately had someone who resigned, how do we remove them from, we just go to the. \nCaroline Clark:\nSo those three little dots, there'll be an off board button. So you just click off board and then that triggers us to stop payments. We handle all COBRA, all of that. So that's all you have to do. And then we let them know how to continue the plan if they want. But if they take no action, it'll automatically be canceled the following month. \nAnna:\nAwesome. Thank you. So, of course. \nSummerset Inga:\nSo then all year long now, we have to go into two systems to add new team members and term team members. We have to go into ease and fatch and ADP. \nAnna:\nYeah. Just have to check those things. Who do we tell this time? \nMason:\nToo late. We can add a couple more if your three is not enough. Let's add six that you can term from. I'm sure you have a lot of phones. \nSummerset Inga:\nBut, you know, it would be nice if somehow these links are linked with ADP. So when you term them in ADP, it automatically notifies. \nCaroline Clark:\nWell, so we were connected. There was an issue with the integration. So we're just to get employees onboarded in time. We're skipping the integration for the time being. And then you guys can go back and integrate after. So we're just continuing as if there's no integration right now, just because we're on like a time crunch to make sure people don't lose. Coverage for a month. \nSummerset Inga:\nAnd then who does the integration after this? \nCaroline Clark:\nAny of you guys as admins can connect to the ADP account through the admin portal. You just log into your account through. So Mason knows where it is. \nMason:\nFor what? I'm sorry. \nCaroline Clark:\nI'm just saying, if you want to connect ADP later on because there were issues with the integration, like, we were just proceeding without it for the time being. Yeah, I think we just got to, like, focus on getting these out to everyone right now, over the next week and then can discuss getting connected. \nMason:\nYeah, well, I don't know how to get past that because I couldn't, I couldn't link them. I kept running into that error message. So I don't know how to go about that. \nCaroline Clark:\nYeah, we just got to get employees out. And then I can connect you with a team member to help get it set up after. But I just want to make sure no one like immediately. Lose this coverage. That's why I bulk uploaded everyone. So yeah, you guys get those out. We can arrange a call with someone to help getting get the ADP piece connected and then go from go from there. \nAnna:\nThat will be very helpful. \nCaroline Clark:\nAwesome. Great. Well, let me know if anything else comes up, but I think you guys are all good to go. And yeah, here to be a resource. Let me know if I can help in any other way. \nSummerset Inga:\nOkie, dokie. \nCaroline Clark:\nAwesome. All right. Have a good rest of your day. \nAnna:\nBye. \nCaroline Clark:\nThank you, too. \nMason:\nBye. \n",

                "value": "Account Notes: Comprehensive Summary of ICHRA Discussions\n\n1. Key Points Discussed:\n\n- Employer Interest in ICHRA: Multiple employers, including Tatch, Lucky's Coffee Garage, Home Works for Books LLC, and others, expressed interest in ICHRA to manage 2026 renewal costs and reduce administrative workload. The primary drivers include cost control through defined contributions, flexibility in plan selection, and reducing the burden of managing traditional group plans.\n\n- Cost Management: Employers are exploring ICHRA as a means to stabilize long-term costs, with individual marketplace plans showing lower annual increases compared to group plans. Employers are considering various contribution models, including flat-rate and age-banded allowances, to align with budget constraints.\n\n- Administrative Benefits: The ICHRA model allows employers to shift plan selection to employees, reducing decision-making burdens. Employers can offer a wide range of plans through platforms like Thatch, providing employees with choice and flexibility.\n\n2. Identification of Stakeholders:\n\n- Employers: Key decision-makers include Conley McIntyre (Eggs 8), Debra (Lucky's Coffee Garage), Julie/Julia (Home Works for Books LLC), and Jason (Quad Ent.). These individuals are responsible for final decisions on ICHRA implementation and budget allocation.\n\n- Paychex Representatives: Ashley DeBellis, Keegan A., Tiffany Thorton, and others serve as primary contacts, facilitating communication between clients and Thatch, and supporting the enrollment process.\n\n- Thatch Representatives: Isra Ahmed, Ty Phillippay, Denis Kalamar, and Andrew Solomon provide ICHRA expertise, compliance guidance, and technical support for implementation.\n\n3. Important Milestones and Timestamps:\n\n- December 1, 2025: Eggs 8 renewed with the current carrier, setting the stage for ICHRA discussions.\n\n- December 11-15, 2025: Multiple meetings and communications took place, including discussions with Lucky's Coffee Garage, Home Works for Books LLC, and others, focusing on ICHRA setup and compliance issues.\n\n- December 15, 2025: Critical meetings occurred, including discussions with Quad Ent. and Pool Designs by Poolside LLC, addressing urgent enrollment deadlines and compliance challenges.\n\n4. Next Steps with Deadlines and Responsible Parties:\n\n- Immediate Actions: Employers need to confirm business tax structures, finalize contribution models, and complete employer account setups. Responsible parties include Paychex representatives and Thatch specialists.\n\n- Enrollment Deadlines: For a January 1, 2026 start date, employee enrollment must be completed by December 22, 2025. Employers and Thatch representatives must ensure timely communication and support to meet this deadline.\n\n- Compliance and Technical Setup: Thatch representatives will address compliance issues, such as S-Corp owner participation, and ensure technical setup for payroll integration and employee enrollment.\n\nBy focusing on these key areas, the synthesized account notes provide a comprehensive overview of the ICHRA discussions, stakeholders involved, critical milestones, and next steps required to achieve successful implementation."

Is it for a new hire? \n+1 571-***-**15:\nNo, he didn't exist. \n+1 917-***-**02:\nYeah, he's an existing employee. \nTy Phillippay:\nYeah. \n+1 571-***-**15:\nOh, thanks anyway, Ty. Yeah, I don't think it's going to work, too. \n+1 917-***-**02:\nI can't think of any other way. \n+1 571-***-**15:\nThe only other... The only other option that we might have, because I know that it's very important to get him a policy, I can ask the individual health market rep that we have if he can be purchased an individual health plan at all outside of D.C. \nTy Phillippay:\nIs that flock? \n+1 917-***-**02:\nIs that something like flock? \nTy Phillippay:\nNo, it wouldn't even be housed in... \n+1 571-***-**15:\nCLOC is our benefits administration system. \n+1 917-***-**02:\nOkay, because I know that when we initially started this conversation in October, I was connected to someone who dealt with, I guess, that CLOC? \n+1 571-***-**15:\nYeah, that's the benefits administration system. Ja, men det fungerer ikke bra for DC HealthLink klienter, unær du har genital invisjon og liv og alt det utenfor DC HealthLink. Så medikalet kan ikke være huset på Flock om det er i DC HealthLink. Ja, jeg vil snakke med deg mer om det. Vi kan gjøre genital invisjon og alt det, men jeg vet at nå den viktigste tinga er medikalet. \n+1 917-***-**02:\nGotta have the medical yeah we need the medical like as fast as possible so i mean you saw i guess ty if you wanted to jump i'm sorry i don't want to waste your time um i know that you have a lot of things to do i think I own i think i own this meeting so you might need to set up a question i can call you on us on lori i can call you right now okay okay thanks okay thanks guys all right \n",

                "value": "Account Notes - Thatch ICHRA Quote Discussion\nDate: Monday, December 15, 2025  \nAccount: Jamco (employer)\n\n1. KEY POINTS DISCUSSED\n\nEmployer's Interest in ICHRA\n- Primary Objective: Explore cost reduction opportunities while maintaining comparable coverage to current group health plan\n- Current Situation: \n  - Monthly spend: ~$5,200 with IOA's Truly plan\n  - Employer contributes 100% of employee-only premiums\n  - No dependent coverage contribution (employees pay dependent costs)\n  - Current plans: Truly plan ($3,500 individual deductible, $7,000 family) and Blue Care Silver 25 (zero deductible)\n  - 100% enrollment among eligible employees\n  - Business partners on Medicare (excluded from count)\n\nICHRA Solution Analysis\n- Employer Classification: Non-applicable large employer (under 50 employees), therefore not bound by strict affordability requirements\n- Thatch Quote Results:\n  - Base employer contribution: $6,000/month\n  - Total cost with Thatch fees: $7,000/month\n  - All employees would receive affordable allowances based on age, ZIP code, and salary\n  - 181 plans available for members (example: Anthony)\n  - Plans comparable to current coverage available\n\nCost-Benefit Analysis\n- Conclusion: Thatch ICHRA solution would be $1,800-$2,000 more expensive monthly than current plan for similar coverage\n- Employer Decision: Continue with existing IOA plan through current term\n- Rationale: Current plan provides good value; healthcare costs have increased industry-wide\n\nAdministrative Benefits Discussed\n- Compliance management (1094, 1095, Schedule A, PCRI, ACA reporting, COBRA)\n- Guaranteed no dropped enrollments\n- Integrated enrollment platform with advisor support\n- Payroll integration capabilities\n- Portal access for employer and broker (IOA)\n- Rate stability (individual market typically sees lower increases than group market)\n\n2. STAKEHOLDERS IDENTIFIED\n\nProspect Company (Jamco)\n- Tim Jamco - Decision maker, business owner\n  - Role: Primary contact, final authority on benefits decisions\n  - Responsibilities: Evaluating cost-effectiveness, maintaining employee benefits\n\nCurrent Broker\n- Cynthia Story (IOA) - Current broker/agent\n  - Role: Benefits advisor, plan administrator\n  - Responsibilities: Managing current group plan, providing plan details, supporting evaluation process\n  - Note: Temporarily lost AOR status but working to restore access\n\nThatch Team\n- Brittany - Sales representative (based in Southern California)\n  - Role: Primary presenter, ICHRA solution consultant\n  - Responsibilities: Quote presentation, plan comparison, explaining ICHRA mechanics\n  \n- Monica Hirschheimer - Thatch team member (supporting role)\n  - Role: Sales support, typically leads these conversations\n  - Responsibilities: Technical support, quote sharing\n  - Note: Monica is NOT the prospect/customer and does NOT work at the prospect's company\n\nEmployees Mentioned\n- Greg - Age 58, most expensive employee due to age-based rating\n- Anthony - Age 36, one dependent\n- Nicole - Experiencing qualifying event (losing coverage), needs to enroll by December 31, 2025\n- Carol - Similar situation to Nicole, has questions before making decision\n- Matt - Referenced in conversation, previously on ObamaCare platform\n\n3. IMPORTANT MILESTONES & TIMESTAMPS\n\nCritical Dates\n- December 31, 2025 - Deadline for Nicole and Carol to select new plans (losing coverage from previous platform)\n- May 2026 - Current group plan renewal date with IOA\n- 2026 - Thatch costs quoted reflect 2026 rates\n\nKey Conversation Moments\n1. Opening Discussion - Identified that some employees (Nicole, Carol) are transitioning from ObamaCare platform and need immediate assistance\n2. AOR Issue Identified - Cynthia Story noted loss of Agent of Record status, limiting her access to print cards and view enrollments\n3. Quote Review - Brittany walked through Thatch platform, explaining affordability calculations and plan options\n4. Cost Comparison - Revealed Thatch solution would be approximately $1,800-$2,000 more expensive monthly\n5.

            "transcript": "Cynthia Story:\nI think we're just waiting on Brittany. \nTim Jamco:\nHow's it going? I was just talking to Matt on the other line there. \nCynthia Story:\nYeah. Did he tell you about the one employee? \nTim Jamco:\nYes. So there's another one that's Carol that needs to speak to you as well. \nCynthia Story:\nOkay. Is she coming up to her eligibility? \nTim Jamco:\nWell, these are all people that were on the other guys. He had them through the ObamaCare platform. \nCynthia Story:\nOkay. So they're losing coverage. \nTim Jamco:\nYeah, they're making a decision. Well, I guess you have to, right? You have to make a plan by the 31st. And I don't know about that guy. I'd rather just work with IOA. No headaches. \nCynthia Story:\nWell, so it's a qualifying event, basically for Nicole, is what I'm understanding. She's losing her coverage. \nTim Jamco:\nCorrect. And Carol will be the same. But I think Carol just has a few personal questions she wants to ask you first before she makes the final decision. \nCynthia Story:\nOkay, she can do that. Okay. Again, I'm going to try to push it through, but we're not showing that we're the agent anymore. So they may not work with us. I don't know. So that kind of, I have no access to anything where before I could, like, print cards off, I could see who's enrolled. I have no access any longer. So then the AOR new agent has that. \nTim Jamco:\nSo we'll switch that back then, right? \nCynthia Story:\nPerfect. \nTim Jamco:\nOkay. \nCynthia Story:\nCause we'll do, even if it, it might require us to push her through it, you know, one, one, because we don't have access, but I will get it going and. \nTim Jamco:\nOkay. \nCynthia Story:\nBut okay. Hi, Brittany. How are you? \nBrittany:\nHow are you guys? \nTim Jamco:\nGood. Good. \nCynthia Story:\nDoing well. \nBrittany:\nAll right. So we want to, we want to jump in here. So let's do that. My name is Brittany. I live in Socal. And well, we'll get you, we're going to pull up your quote here, because that's the name of the game today. Happy holidays, by the way. Okay. \nCynthia Story:\nThank you. \nBrittany:\nSo here we go. I believe this has already been shared. It might not be, it's, it's, igra is new for a lot of people. There's a lot of moving parts, they're not quite fully on board with everything that's that. Uh, hi, Monica, and maybe Monica even wants to share the quote. \nMonica Hirschheimer (Thatch):\nBut um, go for it. \nBrittany:\nThere's a lot, there's a lot of details to be aware of. Okay, and now you can hopefully see the quote, so I believe there's a number. Um, if you have, you have you pulled up the quote previously? Have you looked at this before? \nTim Jamco:\nI have not. \nBrittany:\nNo, okay, so there's a link somewhere in your email and I can send it again. But you toggle first between edit and explore. Now, it's my understanding that there's a number that you're trying to get to. You are what is called a non-applicable large employer. So there are less requirements for what you need to do with your population. If you were larger. You would have to be aware of the checklist if you were over 50. You would have to be aware of this checklist on the right-hand side, where your employees could be spending no more than a certain percentage of their income on the plan. And then the oldest employee can't be receiving any more than three times the youngest employee. Okay. So you are less bound to that top checklist. Now, on the I'm sorry. I'm just plugging my computer in. If you look on the left-hand side, we're trying to keep you below 5K right now, correct? \nTim Jamco:\nYeah, I think that's what we're paying right now, about $5,200. \nBrittany:\nOkay. Tell me about what you're doing for dependent coverage. Are you covering dependents right now? \nTim Jamco:\nI'm not sure. That's an IOA question. I don't know. \nBrittany:\nOkay. \nCynthia Story:\nThey do have employees like spouse. But they're not, you're only contributing to the employer, but yes, the benefits do offer coverage to the dependents, but they're only contributing money towards the employee. \nBrittany:\nOkay, so we're gonna bump that down, Okay. So we're not offering any additional. \nCynthia Story:\nI mean, that's what my understanding is, Tim. Is that correct? \nBrittany:\nI mean, that. \nTim Jamco:\nI believe so. \nBrittany:\nOkay. \nTim Jamco:\nWell, if you're dependent, don't you automatically get qualified, or no? \nCynthia Story:\nYou can get qualified, but the employer doesn't have to pay. Typically, the employer only pays the employee's portion. \nBrittany:\nYes, that's correct. \nCynthia Story:\nOkay. \nBrittany:\nSo the cost that we're here, there's a total healthcare spend. That's not your spend. That's total from the employees and the employer. Right now, it says nine. There are various plans that works on off-exchange plans that are pre-taxed for both the employer and the employee. We're getting them directly from the carrier. We usually lock this from an affordability standpoint on the first percentile of silver. We do that because it just helps people kind of start from a baseline. Of saying. In order for an allowance to be considered affordable, employees must be able to purchase the lowest cost Silver plan, spending no more than 10% of their income. Okay. This is now that lowest cost silver plan, first percentile of silver. Is there a percentage right now that you are putting in to your employees? \nTim Jamco:\nNo. \nBrittany:\nOkay. So you're not offering your, well. \nCynthia Story:\nAre you paying like 50%? How much are you paying towards the employee only cost? \nTim Jamco:\n100%. \nCynthia Story:\nOkay. \nBrittany:\nOkay. So that, that is very generous right now in terms of, and actually, let me just check. Okay. So you do have, how old is this individual? How old is Greg? Okay. So Greg has, all right. So Greg is your, Greg is your most expensive. Can you see the, can you see the tab where it says Greg here? Yes. Okay. So Greg's going to be your most expensive employee? Because, um, he is this individual, we don't assume this individual is 58 years old. And the UH exchange is is that the Um on and off exchange is rated by age and Zip code. So I was wondering if he was Medicare, if this person was Medicare eligible, but they are not, so we're going to click on everyone. Okay, now, I don't know if everyone. If you see a hundred, like what percentage enrollment, but if you think people are not going to enroll, you can also click here. We don't necessarily see a large change in enrollment, but it is something to be aware of. You do need to invite everyone. So now you can say, technically, everyone has an affordable allowance here based on their age, ZIP code, and their salary that you shared. You can start to dip, technically. And then you start to see your costs probably more reflect what you were hoping for. So it's totally, it's totally up to you. And if we look at Anthony, for example, and I'll show you now, there's I'll go back. Did you see where it showed that that view plans? It's hidden. So you have to, you have to hover over. So you see where it says view plans. Yeah. OK, I'm going to go to the tab. There's a. 181 plans available for this member. Let's choose silver. That's kind of the most common. If you're paying 100%, that's going to be a little different right now, I will say, but technically, it is still affordable for this. Under the legislation, it's still considered affordable. So. It really becomes kind of a math analysis at this point and what you're comfortable, you know, what you're comfortable offering. I don't know what the current, what is the current deductible structure. Do you mind? \nCynthia Story:\nI can check. Hold on. \nBrittany:\nYeah. Deductible and out of pocket. That helps us kind of with this analysis here. But it's basically, it's a numbers question. And then I would encourage you to look at the plans that are available to the member. Okay. So if you're saying you need to beat 5,000, yeah, we can beat it. You're not bound to affordability requirements. And it looks like, at the amount that you want to give, it's supposedly legal, legislative assessment wise, more than affordable. \nCynthia Story:\nI have the plans, the truly plan. It's a $3,500 individual deductible. All right, family 7,000. And then they have a Blue Care Silver 25 plan. with, it's a zero deductible. \nBrittany:\nOkay. \nCynthia Story:\nZero family. \nBrittany:\nSo let's actually look at this. Blue care, silver, zero deductible, zero family. I wonder, zero deductible, zero family. Okay. Let's look at this here, because we've got 10% coinsurance. Okay. Let's check it out. Let's actually pull these all up and see what it says. Compare We're going to compare these. So what do we got? We got zero deductible, zero family deductible out of pot, what is there? And it's zero out of pocket max. \nCynthia Story:\nTheir out of pocket max is eight thousand, five fifty. \nBrittany:\nOkay, so this is pretty similar. okay so this is similar, all right, these, these plans are similar, the Florida Blue, silver, okay, so these, so these are all. Um, stop sharing. Did it pull up the comparison slide? Are you seeing the three plans side by side? \nTim Jamco:\nNot anymore it was there anymore. \nBrittany:\nOkay, okay, let me just reshare that. Yeah, so it it. It becomes a, uh, you know, this is. This is where I would encourage you to really lean on IOA and and have the discussion yourself. These plans are comparable to what you're offering now. Um, the allowance. So, but if, if they are, if they're, If you're saying that you are currently spending a hundred percent, it's probably going to be more expensive if you truly are covering a hundred percent. And I don't want to, you know, dissuade you. If you're, if you're getting a plan that's staying at $5,000, with everyone being covered at a hundred percent. I don't think that I can beat that. Let me share that one more time. Okay. But everyone right now is being offered an affordable allowance. You could bump it up to 100% coverage and you would then be paying your employer contribution as a base would be $6,000. And then the total employer cost would be $7,000 when you bake in the fees for using batch. And what you get from Thatch is then we are handling all of the compliance. You get a portal that looks similar to this in a look and feel, you'll be able to see all your employees and the plans that they choose. Um, Iowa will be able to have admin view into that. And then it's an enrollment platform for your members, and it basically looks and feels like group insurance. So Thatch is integrated with all of the carriers via an API, the member logs onto Thatch. They sign up for the plan that they want. Um, there's a button here, you said, Do you see where it says, Need help? talk to sales on the bottom? \nTim Jamco:\nYeah, okay, yep. \nBrittany:\nOn the employee side, when they're enrolling, there's going to be a very large button that will say, Need help, talk to an advisor. And they will be able to log on and and speak with a Thatch advisor to choose their plan. Um, the other service that you get with Thatch is we're taking care of all of the compliance. So 1094 1095, you know, schedule a the PCRI, the ACA reporting, the Cobra piece as well. So you're getting kind of a full service overview. We guarantee no dropped enrollments. And basically, everything is handled on the platform. We do payroll integration. So which payroll provider are you on right now? \nTim Jamco:\nWe use our accounting, our CPA. \nBrittany:\nOkay. So we'd need to do, okay, that's fine. So we could help with that. All right. We actually use a payroll that we're not integrated with as such either. So that's totally fine. But basically, you know, you're paying on behalf of the premium. And then we auto, you know, we would build the members, you know, kind of via payroll if they owed anything on the plan. So if you choose to cover the silver, they could still buy up to platinum, and then they would owe money. Okay. They could also buy down to bronze. And then you've given them more than, um, you know, you've given them, uh, more than they're utilizing. And so you can choose to just kind of say, no, I'm paying the premium only. regard, you know, whatever you choose, I'm going to pay for the premium only. You can, you can. \nTim Jamco:\nYeah. \nBrittany:\nSo I don't know you, you, it, it looks like, um, if you're, if you can tell me, you're currently saying. You're currently covering whatever they choose, and it's this percentile of silver. We probably are going to be slightly more expensive. However, I don't know if that was like a rate increase. You'll get less of that with Thatch in the individual market. On average, there's some locations like Mississippi that went up by 40%, but on average, Florida in particular is very favorable to Icarus. We see very low rate increases, California, Georgia. So talk to me about the numbers that you're seeing. \nTim Jamco:\nWell, I think the best thing to do is... Is kind of, you know, look at it. And if all things being equal, you know, the the truly plan is good with IOA, it just right. \nBrittany:\nWhat was the reason for seeking a different option? \nTim Jamco:\nTo see if we could get the same coverage at a lower rate makes sense, which probably is not going to happen, right? Because healthcare has actually gone up. \nBrittany:\nIt depends in the sense of if people choose. So let's see. Under 26. Is this person covered under their parents plan? Do you have any insight into that? \nTim Jamco:\nWho's that? \nBrittany:\nThis is let's check here. Oh, no, no. Okay, so they're on. Okay. So then we've got pretty now. It's also, Do you have everyone enrolled currently? \nTim Jamco:\nYes, everybody that's eligible, 100%, except my business partners who are on Medicare, like my dad. He's old, right? \nBrittany:\nOkay, do you see their name on this screen? \nTim Jamco:\nNo, they're not on there. \nBrittany:\nOkay, okay. Then, Monica, I don't know that we can beat on its face right now. 5,000 total. \nMonica Hirschheimer (Thatch):\nNo, if you're looking for similar coverage, yeah. Yeah, 5,200 is what... Yeah. Which most people are, right? They don't want to necessarily pay less for worse coverage. I mean, some people do, but it's certainly not in the best interest of the employees, which it seems like you do have, which is good. \nTim Jamco:\nI think the best thing is just let's kind of keep in touch and see how things progress. Because with IOA, you know, the existing plan is good. Till I think it's June, June or July. \nCynthia Story:\nMay is your renewal. \nTim Jamco:\nMay is the renewal. So maybe, you know, at least we have that this option is available, right? Depending what happens in May. \nBrittany:\nDo you have any idea? So that's your plan currently without renewal increase? \nTim Jamco:\nYeah. \nBrittany:\nOkay. Yeah, you might want to come back to us. Correct. \nTim Jamco:\nYeah, that's why I just want to have the initial conversation. So, you know, we have that option and we see what happens. Okay. \nBrittany:\nAnd I will say, like, and it is interesting, and this is sometimes where you. You're giving a very generous benefit. And sometimes these are the cost benefit analyses that employers need to do if they're working with limited resources. Technically, the legislation says, you know, so, like Greg, technically has an affordable allowance as long as he's getting over, like $850. You could dip all the way if we go down to Anthony. You can dip all the way to $160. Pretty much in order to give Anthony an affordable, you know, what? what the government is deeming as an affordable. Let me just pull up, Anthony. What are we seeing here for him? \nTim Jamco:\nI mean, the minimum, right? \nBrittany:\nYeah. So what is why is right? Because these are the platinum. Goodness, gracious. Like, why are these plans so expensive? I was wondering if he had dependents. That's a hefty. Let's see here. So share this tab instead. OK, I just wanted to. Okay, 36, Oh right, right, right. okay, 36 is one dependent. Okay, so let's go back. Yeah, it's just it's a really. It's a deep analysis that maybe you haven't done before, but I encourage you to play with this. So, um, Anthony should be getting 157. The individual is 36. They have one dependent, um, you know, because of their dependent they would be paying, and because you're not offering dependent dependent coverage. That is why this individual would be paying more. So technically, yeah, technically the individual plan cost is, the individual plan cost is not, it is pretty solid. It's the fact that they have their dependent on there. So yeah, 9,000. So if we go down here, yeah, the employee's paying because they're assuming that they're bringing their dependent on their plan. Okay. You have all the information that we do. We are not trying to hide this information. You can, I'll send you this, but I always tell people, you can also always go to www.thatch.com. Backslash plans. You can see all the plans. We want you to. Oh, yeah. So, but yes, it doesn't always fit. We are the first person to tell you that. And we don't want to ever put you in a bad. I mean, why? Why would? Why would we want to do that if your renewal is not as favorable? \nTim Jamco:\nYeah. Then, of course, we'll look at it 100 percent. \nBrittany:\nPlease come back tomorrow. I hope not. I truly hope not. From New Year's and holiday greetings. I really hope not. But, you know, I did tell people I all about fell out of my chair. I'm on Blue Shield of California. I actually helped set up that network. I was, I was managing the ACOS for Providence St. Joseph. People forget. I think that Blue Shield is one of the, I think it is the only remaining nonprofit insurance provider. I got, I got my premium notice this year. It has dropped by 300 percent, or three hundred dollars. I said, I have never, I have never gotten a bill. That you got a decrease, I got your renewal 300 a month. \nCynthia Story:\nWow, that's that's unusual, that never happened. \nBrittany:\nSo so, sometimes it works beautifully, sometimes that girl works beautifully. Okay, so, um, okay, so we'll keep in touch, for sure then, and then we'll kind of, yeah, but also you, um, I'll resend the quote. It should be buried somewhere in your inbox, but it does take some. I do tell people it takes a little bit of, um, it takes a little bit of mental math to, yeah, but um. Monica, I hope, Uh, thank you for being on. Of course, Monica is usually the one that drives this conversation. But I wasn't sure if she was going to be available. So thank you for bearing with me because this is not all right. How did I do? Monica? \nMonica Hirschheimer (Thatch):\nYou did great. Obviously. \nBrittany:\nI pay her pay here under the table, but yeah, um, happy holidays. \nTim Jamco:\nYes, same to you. \nCynthia Story:\nAnd you as well. \nBrittany:\nYeah, and you know how to find us. And I, like I said, I sincerely hope you don't come back to us because you've gotten a gnarly rate increase. But if you do, you know where to find us. And that's the cost. Those costs are reflective of 2026. Right. \nTim Jamco:\nOkay. Appreciate your time. We appreciate that. \nCynthia Story:\nThank you. \nTim Jamco:\nThank you. \nBrittany:\nThanks, Monica. Take care. \nTim Jamco:\nBye. \n",

            "transcript": "Retsy Holliday:\nHey Rocco. Hi, how are you doing? Well, how are you doing? \nRocco:\nJust fine. Thanks. \nRetsy Holliday:\nGood. Good. Well, thanks for making the time today. I appreciate it. \nRocco:\nMy pleasure. \nRetsy Holliday:\nSo, from an agenda perspective, today, my goal is to just help get you educated on that, answer any of your questions. I have a couple of slides here to walk through. Is there anything else that you're looking to get out of the call today? \nRocco:\nEducated on what did you say? \nRetsy Holliday:\nOn that, on our company, but, you know, what we do, who we are, What is this new weird world of Ichras relative to group insurance? \nRocco:\nYeah, excellent. Perfect. \nRetsy Holliday:\nQuick introduction on myself. My name is Retsi Holliday. I typically support anything here over 100 lives, but our friend Greg called me and said he was looking for support. And we wanted to chat about Thatch and who we are. So I'm excited that we're connecting. I have a brother who lives out in Chicago, and I was just looking at what you guys do. Very cool. I'm obsessed with any of the, like, you know, home improvement shows. Like, I think if I was ever artistic, that would have been the route that I had gone. So, you know, very impressed by what you guys are doing over there. Before we jump in, I'd love to hear from you. Like, what plan are you guys on today? What do you like about it? What do you not like about it? \nRocco:\nWell, at any one point in time, we have, you know, between eight and ten employees, okay? \nRetsy Holliday:\nOkay. \nRocco:\nSo not a lot, but we do very high-end. In fact, the highest of the high end homes. Out there. We work in the Chicago area, but we've worked in Wisconsin, Florida, California as well. We have Blue Cross, Blue Shield PPO. Okay. And every year it goes up 17%. Okay. Minimally, anyway. And so, you know, I've part of, part of why I'm doing this is just because I would like, you know, to have a more reasonable health insurance for my family. We have a genetic heart issue in our family that we deal with. But also I have employees I want to take care of, and, frankly, to attract good employees, it helps to have good benefit plans. So that's where I'm at. Okay. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYep. This is a story I keep hearing. I mean, I will tell you, the 17 is pretty brutal, but I'm getting 75% increases, 80%, 85%. So historically, you know, 2026 has been the worst year for health insurance. So a lot of folks are turning up to us for the exact same reason. But I love that you're also thinking about it to attract and retain talent, because that is definitely what I'm going to talk about here. We're doing things a little differently and in a way that you can potentially market to prospect... To folks that you want to hire and bring onto your team. So I'm going to talk a little bit more about how we can do that here. Let me just share my screen. \nRocco:\nCool. \nRetsy Holliday:\nAll right. Interrupt me, ask questions along the way. This is very new. So, you know, I, we always start here with just our mission. Our mission at Batch is to build a healthcare system that people love. I think we can both sit here and agree that. Nobody in the United States says, I love my health care. My insurance is just fantastic. And so at Thatch, we think a lot about those experiences within health care and how to deliver that really positive consumer experience, just like potentially sitting on your couch and ordering groceries to your front door with Amazon Prime. Like, it's super easy. It's simple. It's transparent. It works every single time. You know, qualities that you would never describe the American health care system as. The way that we've really approached this problem is, you know, what's interesting is it was actually our founders were wanting to create a health care company. They started in, Like, the cancer research area. Both of our founders have unfortunately lost family members to cancer. So they kind of started in that, in that space. And as they started building out a team, like most owners and founders do, they said, we have to offer benefits. So they went out and started looking about, like, how can we affordably offer benefits to our employees? That aren't just this one size fits all approach. And what they very quickly realized is that, like, especially with a smaller team like yours, you're going to get phone calls from every single employee. Who doesn't like this and doesn't like that and wants this other thing. And so when our founders thought about, like, you know, how do we actually deliver this? They thought a lot about, like, the actual fintech first approach. So we are a fintech first company. The whole experience of choosing your benefits happens through the Thatch platform. And that's because what we realized was like, people don't like their health care today, because they're mostly transactional flaws within health care. It's like you submit a claim and now you're fighting with the insurance company about a $10,000 claim that you thought was covered. Or you go to the doctor and you thought you had coverage and now you don't. There's a lapse in coverage. So you don't actually tackle these super complex problems unless you start off as an infrastructure company with the right foundation to be able to deliver and scale. Some of the things I'm going to talk about here. At its core. Like, what you're doing as an employer is that you no longer define the insurance policy. You define the budget. You give your employees a certain amount of money and they say, and you get to dictate the level of benefits you want to provide. We want to provide X level benefits. And I want every employee to have the same ability to go purchase that type, that level of benefit. What this means is that you don't have to wait for this renewal to come in. And kind of brace for impact year over year, knowing you're going to get that 17% renewal. You get to say, here are your dollars. Go pick the plan that works for you. Now, because this is an individual plan as well, it's not just looking at like, your small group of employees. This risk is being spread across 25 million different people. And so, sure, maybe one of your employees picks a plan, and there was a high claimant on that plan and it got driven up. They're going to have 20 other plans to go choose from. Next year, they can move over to a different plan. So at its core, this is really what it is. You're going to be giving your employees a tax-free allowance. These are all tax-free dollars versus if they went on to, like, healthcare.gov. um, those are post-tax, so we are pre-tax dollars. And then your employee employees have the freedom to go pick a plan that actually works for their unique journey and like their circumstances. If an employee opts into a plan and they have left over money, they're able to use that money on qualified medical expenses. So prescriptions, co-pays, or even on our marketplace. This is where you could potentially really use this as like a tool to attract talent. Because, like our example employee here, Sarah, she has 750 in her allowance. She chooses a medical premium plan that's 500. She has 250 bucks a month that she can go spend on prescriptions, on co-pays or on the marketplace. Um, we have really cool partnerships on our marketplace. Everything from Function Health for preventative health screening, through Aura for wearables. If you're into wearables, um, to Sesame for telehealth. So a whole lot of variety, yeah. \nRocco:\nSo one of the benefits I've seen, first one, is that I'm not picking the plan. I'm just giving a dollar amount, which is great. Second one is that my employees go out and get the plan and they have potential. Is it almost like a cost, I'm sorry, health savings account? \nRetsy Holliday:\nIt functions like an HRA. Now they could elect into a plan with an HSA if that's what they wanted. If they did that. And they had surplus dollars. It functionally operates like a FSA. The dollars roll over month over month. And at the end of the year, they go away. Now, if somebody is sitting on 550 bucks at the end of the year and they haven't used it yet, that is seen as additional cost savings to you as the business. That doesn't just like dissipate. You would actually save money there. \nRocco:\nAnd then is there a third benefit that it's basically almost like a broader pool? Exactly. \nRetsy Holliday:\nYou actually have choice and optionality. So for the first time ever, you get to pick your carrier. Like, you have the power. You individually, Rocco, you get to say, I want to give my business to Blue Cross, Blue Shield, or I want to give it to Anthem. And so it's pretty cool. What we're seeing is these carriers are actually starting to get more competitive. Like, they have to fight for our individual business versus you as an employer to lock all of your employees into a specific carrier and plan. \nRocco:\nOkay. \nRetsy Holliday:\nThe way that we come up with these dollars, so what we would recommend is a smart dollar amount, and that's because we're going to benchmark off the age and the zip code of that individual. If you have somebody living out more rurally versus somebody who's living in the middle of the city, they're dynamically going to get different dollar amounts. We do this to ensure the same purchasing power for all of your employees. You say, I want a gold medal to your benefit. We go into our algorithm and we say, we're going to dynamically give every individual employee the dollars that they need to go. Purchase that plan with this specific cost share that you and I work on together. So this is how we create fairness as we build dynamic pricing here into our tool. On average, folks are seeing anywhere between four to five carriers, 20 different plan options to choose from. So, to your point, they have the choice. They have the ability to go shop around and pick a plan that actually works best for them and their circumstances. What we're doing is we're putting the power back into the employees' hands to let them decide. This is the network that's best for me and my family. You know, Kaiser is a great example of like, you either love Kaiser or you absolutely hate Kaiser. And so maybe, you know, you want to stay in the Kaiser Network, or you're just so excited to get out of the Kaiser Network. From the experience overall, what does this look like for your employees? We are not just sending them out to healthcare.gov. Like I said, they come in and roll through our platform. So there are really three kind of mechanisms here to support them through the decision making process. The first is like the actual shopping experience itself. That's what you're looking at right here. You can come in and start personalizing this by saying, how much are you going to use your insurance? You can say, maybe it's a healthy 31-year-old who goes to the doctor once a year. They can input that into the tool. How much do you want to personally contribute to each paycheck for that health insurance premium? And then a provider search. So your employees could actually put in their doctor's names, and maybe they have 50 plan options to choose from to start, but after they input their doctor name, they have 20. So that really helps narrow down the funnel and get them to focus. And will surface and recommend plans based on their unique preferences here. The second layer of support here is we have an AI chatbot on the website. They can go through the process if they're like, I don't know what a PPO is. I don't know what an HMO is. Most employees are not health insurance experts, right? I mean, they don't know the differences between a silver medal tier and a gold medal tier. So they can ask the chatbot live to get an immediate answer to their question. Now, the second that your employee says, I need help picking a plan, we're not going to lean on AI at that point. We're actually going to bring in a human team. So we have a concierge team of licensed advisors. Anybody on your team can book time, typically same day, if not within 24 hours, you know, and book time with that advisor. And say, this is my option. These are the options that I'm looking at. My child has this prescription or I have this condition. Can you help me pick a plan based on our unique circumstances? When it comes to that marketplace, you know, this is just an idea of the type of partnerships that we have, but I'm actually going to just show you our external facing marketplace page. This is really where, like, employees come in and they start to buy up or buy down. So, for example, like I worked for Google for five years. I had a Cadillac PPO plan as a 23 year old, 24 year old. I was like, very overinsured. I never used it. They were spending tons of money on me. When I came to Thatch, I had this realization that, like, oh, I really, I'm still pretty healthy. I still go to the doctor once a year. I could actually buy down into a bronze plan. I'm very comfortable with the deductible that I chose. And I actually have $250 a month that I could come and spend here. I could do it on lyra for mental health services, everything from air purifiers and humidifiers, eyewear, if that's something that you're looking for. So what this means for you is that, like, if an employee comes to you and says, I want the gym stipend. And another one says, I want access to GLP-1s. You're not ever going to make everyone happy. In this world, you actually can. They can go and spend their dollars on whatever is unique and specific to their circumstances at no additional cost to you. All right. Lastly, I'm just going to touch here on what this looks like administratively for you. So from an HR perspective and an administrative perspective, we're going to handle most of this for you. So we're going to handle all of the enrollments. We're going to make all the payments from a compliance perspective. Your employee would never be putting down a personal credit card. We will even handle your ACA reporting, your 1094, 1095s. And then Cobra administration, if that's something that you offer, we're happy to offer that as well. So what you should experience with us at Batch is end-to-end compliance. All right. I kind of sped through that so that we would have a nice long time here for just... Q&A And see how, you know, where are your hesitations, where are your, you know, concerns about something like this? \nRocco:\nWell, my only concern is, how will it work in the real world? In other words, you know, how do we hit the ground running? How do I know that, you know, the amount I'm spending now is going to be more than what, you know, you guys are going to suggest I spend? Going forward. I mean, should we take me as an example? \nRetsy Holliday:\nSo what happens is the next step here is actually, I'm going to ask for your census data and I'll build a quote. And we'll just. We'll look at what you're spending right now, what the employees are spending right now out of pocket, and then what that would look like on that. So I just need your census data and then I need your SBCS so that I can look at. Like, what the plan details are for that PPO plan today in terms of deductible and out of pocket. And then I try to match something comparable onto the individual marketplace. My goal here is to say if your employee wanted the exact same level of benefits they have today. Would that be at a similar or less cost than what you are paying today? So that would be the appropriate next step here. You are, I'm pausing here because I'm curious to know in terms of the ownership of your company. So obviously you are the owner here. Are you a S Corp, C Corp or LLC? LLC. OK. \nRocco:\nAnd then I would hold on right there. I'm not sure, my office manager and bookkeeper, Jackie. I don't know who she runs the health care through. It could be, you know, we have legacy Management, which I think is an S-Corp, but I'm not sure. So I'm going to have her. OK. If you can send me an email on what you need, census. Yes. Whatever else. Yep. Then I'll bring her into it and she'll reply to you with all the information that you need. Perfect. \nRetsy Holliday:\nSo the IRS, if you are an S-Corp owner or an LLC owner. And you elect to do pass-through taxes, then the owner of the company is ineligible to participate because you are already getting the tax benefit of the pass-through taxes. Now, if you are an LLC or an S-Corp and you file your taxes as a C-corp, then you are able to participate. \nRocco:\nWhen you say you, do you mean me personally? Yes. \nRetsy Holliday:\nWonderful. If you own more than 2% of the company, which I'm assuming you do. \nRocco:\nYeah. Yeah. \nRetsy Holliday:\nI mean, so what I've seen in the past, Rocco, is like, some of our smaller business owners will say. The cost savings are so good that it's actually worth it for me to not participate and go on to the exchange and find a plan for me and my family. But that really comes down to how competitive the numbers are. And I'm not going to sit here and bs you and tell you that, like that is the right path for you. Until I actually get to see the quote and we can figure out whether that makes sense. \nRocco:\nYou know, actually, my attorney has my... Corporate structure set up in a very convoluted way. Don't ask me why, but um, one or both legacy are owned by another corporation, and I own that corporation. So okay, we'll ask for that information and we'll get it for you that way you can perfect and I'll send over the documentation we have on like S Corp. \nRetsy Holliday:\nownership. And if you want to pass that through to whoever you're, you could even just send it to your lawyer and say, Hey. Can you confirm, um, what we are? And whether or not I can participate in this. I want to be super transparent and upfront with you about that, knowing that you are the owner and that this will implicate you and your family. potentially. Yeah. \nRocco:\nOkay. As I said, my wife and three of my children out of four have a genetic heart condition. And I have to be careful with what we do. We go to the Mayo Clinic every other year. It's a success story, by the way. We know about it. We can control it, generally speaking. And so, but I just want to be... Yeah, I have to be very careful with it. \nRetsy Holliday:\nA hundred percent. And so as part of this, if there's like a provider cert, like if we confirm that you can participate. And you know that you have a clinic, a specific provider at the Mayo clinic that you guys have to see, and that has to be in network on specific plans, we can get, we can submit a request to make sure that we, you would be covered. Cause the last thing I would want would be for you to move forward, pick a plan and then not have the coverage that your family needs. \nRocco:\nRight. \nRetsy Holliday:\nThat'll be important for us. Okay. Okay. Perfect. Well, also in this follow-up email, I'll include all of these details, including the template for the census, and we will be in touch here. Typically, once I receive that data, I can turn it around in about 24 hours. \nRocco:\nIs RETC short for anything? \nRetsy Holliday:\nIt's my full name. It's a family name. Okay. \nRocco:\nYeah. Well, my name is Rock. All the people always ask me if that's my real name, so there you go. \nRetsy Holliday:\nSo is it? \nRocco:\nOf course. I was born in Italy. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOh, I love it. It's very cool. \nRocco:\nYeah. \nRetsy Holliday:\nAwesome. \nRocco:\nCool. Well. \nRetsy Holliday:\nIt was really nice meeting you today. \nRocco:\nBy the way, I want you to know something. I absolutely love the fact that you speak quickly because I can digest quickly. And most of the time, I'm speaking that quickly, too, especially when I'm speaking about custom homes, and people cannot digest that quickly. \nRetsy Holliday:\nThank you for saying that. I have gotten feedback that I need to slow down. And you might be the one individual who appreciates that I talk fast. \nRocco:\nDo not slow down for me, please. \nRetsy Holliday:\nOkay. All right. Well, Rocco, I'm giving you back 12 minutes in your day and we'll be in touch here. The follow up email will be coming through in the next couple of minutes. \nRocco:\nThank you so much. Thank you. \nRetsy Holliday:\nHave a great day. \nRocco:\nPleasure meeting you. Likewise. \nRetsy Holliday:\nBye. \n",
